    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nFirst into the tank is a tool that brings kids imaginations to the next level. Hey Sharks, I'm Ky and I'm Max. We're from Philadelphia and we're looking for $250,000 for 5% of our company. Now, sharks, we all know that a child's creativity knows no bounds. , look, I'm a cardboard knight. Luckily, I'm a cardboard astronaut with a jetpack. And that stack of sturdy cardboard boxes from all the stuff that we've bought online is perfect to be upcycled for kids art projects. But when it comes to working with cardboard, the tools for kids, don't cut it. Scissors. We love you, but stick to paper. , box cutter. Not till you're older. Much much older. That's why we created the Chompsaw, the kids safe power tool for cutting cardboard and building 3D models with ease. Because what kid wouldn't want to use a power tool this to make awesome stuff this? Now, the chompsaw works a fast hole punch, which intercepts cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. , Sharks, who's ready to help inventors of all ages unleash their creative potential and cut a deal with the chomp saw? That's pretty cool. I love it. Yeah. , each of you sharks, you have a sample in front of you of our chomp saw. And we'd love for each of you to try cutting out. , when a kid inevitably touches it, what happens? Let me show you. If I try shoving my finger, even if you take the cardboard out, nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Cool. , my suggestion while you're cutting, try and follow the black lines. You look what you're doing. I do not. Now, what's happening here? Now, why isn't it going curving when I turn it? a band saw, if you push this, you have to twist the cardboard. And now you can get nice curves, that. . . Hey, did you say this was for 44 year olds? Yes. It's for kids of all ages. Kids of all ages. Voila. , yeah. Beautiful rock. The kids love it a lot, but every time a parent gets their hands on it, they can't get enough. Yeah. Fun to do, though. Let's go. All . Yeah. All . Yeah. Wow. What's super great is you're taking the cardboard box. Yes. And then creating everything, , anything from a sword to a fish to a castle to whatever. do you send instructions on these different projects? Absolutely. it comes with a simple user manual which explains you how to get started but our website is chock full of special instructions. We are also in the process of developing a monthly subscription for cardboard projects. Every month kids will receive any little materials that they need to complete the project and they'll follow different themes that teach different STEM concepts. I love how you're staying in character too. It's fun to hold. What is the age group that this is intended to? Our target market is eight plus, and that's mainly due to the compliance requirements for products for kids younger than eight. I'm not going to say you can't operate it, but we highly would recommend parental supervision while you do that. I do have a son who is three. He's our number one marketing star. he has blown us up on social media, videos of him operating this tool himself. what I love about this? Everything today is about tablets and computers and phones and this takes you back to the basics of being able to work with your hands and be creative. And people are going back to that. the youth want tactile things and experiences and you have the supply because of the boxes. Exactly. Yeah. 250,000 5% of a $5 million valuation now that we understand exactly what the product does. And by the way, I would say I made the best shark. beautiful. That's a good exercise. Thank you much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. But let's talk about sales because you better have some. Yeah. , we launched less than a year ago for pre-orders only. We haven't delivered our product yet. And in the less than a year since we've launched, we've sold $2.1 million. Is that a Kickstarter or? We originally launched on Kickstarter. We raised close to $1.2 $2 million last October and since then we've raised an additional almost a million dollars. And you haven't delivered a unit yet, ? We haven't delivered any units yet. How many do you owe? We sold close to 10,000 units far. And what price have you put on them? they cost $230. Wow, it's expensive. And how close are you to delivering? Yeah, we'll be shipping them out in about a month. I'm returning our factories in China. I will be back there next weekend to oversee the last production test run of a thousand units. your whole company ride is on the line when you go back to China pretty much. What do they cost you to make? It it costs us 73.81 to make. you're only going to be selling these direct to consumer. now we only sell direct to consumer. But once we have inventory, we want to start to explore. March is not enough to put retail in the middle of this. Kelsey, how did you come up with the idea? Yeah. , I came up with the idea, Max and I both met doing our master's program of product design at the University of Pennsylvania. , and I came up with the idea during a class for that program and the goal was teaching kids design thinking skills and we use cardboard often. We got to the prototyping stage. I realized that working with cardboard is difficult for kids as much as they love it. And have you guys raised money before? We've raised a a total of $5,000 in safe agreements from family members. What valuation? Doesn't matter. It's $5,000. I'm interested if you told him it was worth something at the time. God, I hate safes. Why do you hate safes? Because it's terrible for investors. For the investor, there's no IOU. Hey, I promise to give you equity at some point in the future. With no cap, no interest rate, no discount. , it's ridiculous. A safe note is a piece of paper that means nothing. It's not debt a convertible noted. Sorry, we're going on a tangent on We appreciate that, but I don't how mainstream it is. I don't know why everyone's doing it. All , look, I'll take a flyer on it. There's a bunch of question marks, particularly around production, and we don't have any reviews on the final product shipped. Yeah. , I got to reflect that in my offer. I'll give you the 250,000 for 20%. What's your lead time now? Starting with nothing, it's about 17 weeks. . , that's your biggest challenge, ? It is our biggest challenge because you have uncertainty about your demand. You have uncertainty about the different platforms where you can sell and you have 12 to 17 weeks to turn it around. You can't boom boom boom if we got an order from retail. They need a lot of work. Look, I think you guys are great founders to back. It's too early for me. , I'm out. Understood. Thank you. My accolades to you, Kelsey, in particular. You're rock solid. I'm going to make an offer from 250 for 20%. That's my offer. Same offer. Same offer. We have to decide who you want to work with. It's early with me, but with complete belief because I know people you always product's going to work, but I think it has to get to retail, too. Got two offers. Yes, we do. what? I'm going to make you an offer. One shark is out. Barbara and Kevin have each offered 250,000 for 20% of Kowy and Max's cardboard saw for kids, Chop Shop. But Mark may also be interested. what? I'm going to make you an offer. You have risk obviously in manufacturing, but you guys are product designers, physical product designers. , that whole process. You'll figure that. Your next biggest challenge is pricing. You have good margins, but you don't know how much you're going to sell, but more importantly, you don't know what's involved on the marketing side to get the sales that you want, ? And , I think you're going to have an opportunity to raise your prices. , I think you're going to have a ton of margin. And I think if you do this , it is the hot product of Christmas. And I know in your mind you're already thinking that way, ? But you've got to get it in front of the people. And I think that that's where I can help. what's your offer? , you guys asked for 20%. ? and that's probably too much. I'll ask for 15%. I'll give you the 250K for 15%. Say yes or no now and we have a deal. 250K for 15%. Yeah. This is more than you wanted to give. I know. But 85% of a watermelon is a whole lot better, ? If you would take the 15%, I would go in with Mark. ? . 15% split between the two of you. . Yep. Because I think you have a lot more coming. I heard you. I listened to you. I love how badass you are. 250,000. Mark and I for 15%. That's an amazing offer. Don't get caught up in a couple percentage points, ? I know when you walk in the door, everybody's got that number, ? But I'm telling you, between the two of us, the ability to scale and do it quickly and have questions answered for everything and because we've both been there, we'll save you that delta. , what do you guys think? I think Mark and Lori, you have a deal. Thank you much. Let's cut this up. Thank you much. Super stars for sure. All . Thank you much. You got this. , happy about this. Thank you. Don't leave me hanging. Thank you much. See you guys. Congrats, guys. Thanks much. Thank you.

$400,000 in exchange for 10% equity in our company all sharks who wants to take a shot with me shot take a shot shots we put shots down in front of you see who's Brave shot ready cheers it's apple cider vinegar as you guys know by now that was a shot of apple cider vinegar my god I started drinking apple cider vinegar or ACV to detox and lose weight I loved the way it made me feel but the taste was strong we created mother beverage mother beverage is an allnatural sparkling probiotic drink made with organic fruits and herbs and most importantly apple cider vinegar they're light crisp refreshing and the best part there's only 2 to four g of sugar per bottle what do you say sharks are you ready to try the best tasting apple cider vinegar drink you've ever had your I'm still dying we've got some samples here for you today yeah you better something to compare to this is much better you had you should have warned us though yeah it's strong you can have this shot would you another I think I'm all thank you much I'll take one of these lovely beverages though thank you it doesn't taste as crappy as the shot it tastes sugary soda that's the idea our top sellers are lime Ginger raspberry Rose our pineapple turmeric and blueberry Sage how much apple cider vinegar is in here there's a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar what will that do for you there's a ton of great health benefits to Apple cider vinegar Alison has a personal story about that she started drinking it to detox and to lose weight if you dilute ACV does the function of the apple cider vinegar still stand or is it pretty much you've sub they recommend to dilute it because if you take it straight it's hard on your esophagus and it's hard in your stomach ours is fully unpasturized you want to make sure it still has all the health benefits intact we've prepared a pre-made healthy go-to option to get your daily dose of app advertised exactly tell us about tell us about the business we started about 18 months ago our lifetime sales are about $500,000 what are you going to make this year all all in we're projecting a million dollars we received placement in over 200 locations in a large National Grocery chain is it Whole Foods we are in Whole Foods locally in the Dallas Fort Worth area but it was Albertson how much is this bottle retail it retails for $2.99 to$ 359 based on the Retailer's margin what's the cost to make the product the cost is anywhere between 78 cents and 85 sent a bottle all in that's pretty good for the volumes you have the only way I get out of this thing alive is somebody buys you at some point there's an exit yes sir and that that exit in beverage seems to be at around 50 million when you establish some regional market share the big guys come and take you out as opposed to doing this themselves cuz what you're doing there's nothing proprietary about this anybody can knock you off but we happen to have an expert here who built billion doar brands in beverage let me ask a question tell me why these two are not beverage cockroaches going to get crushed by big guys who want that shelf space back the big guys what they've done is they have subcontracted Innovation to the entrepreneurs of America few brands are being launched by the big beverage companies today they're not cockroaches they have a chance of survival people want to drink beverages that they feel better about in this space the first thing is do you have a functional story we do have a great story we both worked in oil and gas before we did this and I was having a ton of health issues I kept going to different doctors I was sluggish bloating skin problems finally I read online that drinking apple cider vinegar could help with a lot of those problems within 2 weeks everything had subsided but I could not get over the taste I went back to my kitchen and created this we started selling at farmers markets and the Whole Foods buyer tried our product at the farmers market and said you guys have to be in Whole Foods are you now full-time into the vinegar deal how much have you invested currently we've raised about $125,000 at what valuation that was at a $600,000 valuation that was now you're million that was pre- Revenue based on concept that was friends and family a majority of that money was to start our production facility you manufacture this yourself yes sir how big can you get on your current manufacturing footprint 60,000 bottles a month but we do we have already started to finance a fully automated bottling line and this will take us up to $200,000 why would you want to be in the manufacturing business I that's what I'm I can't believe you guys that's a disaster it keeps our cost down we are able but you're in the mud you're in the weeds why would you want to be in the manufacturing business I that's what I'm I can't believe you guys that's a disaster it keeps our cost down we are able you're in the mud you're in the weeds the reason that we don't copack we wanted to keep it raw and unpasteurized I will tell you that if I did not do a deal in my cocktail business I would have gotten swallowed everybody did copy me by nowbody copied me and I knew I needed muscle and distribution you need to come in hot and hard and fast and you need a partner cuz you're still in the kitchen you're not even at Phase zero where you have someone else doing it for you you need to get the hell out of the kitchen and you need to start a business not an artisanal mom and pop beverage business I'm out you're not fully cockroaches yet you're s of larva you're starting and it's early and you haven't gone through any of the pressures of marketing by the big guys as they give you shell space the thing is is with little marketing we have the points of distribution every beverage guy comes in here and the future is bright we got to wear shades but you're still vinegar roaches the valuation is insane I'm out yeah the problem is there's no such thing is a little marketing the hard part is the scaling part and taking people's attention and sales away from other products you're going to have to raise a lot more money after this and that's the part I'm concerned about and as much as I I would love to help a Dallas company I'm out thank you I it it's great that it's low calorie my only concern is struggling with the Competitive Edge I see your vision but I don't think that you have gotten there yet for me I'll be a customer but I won't be a partner I'm out thank you for that there's one shark left then there was one and in the beverage business but I'm not smart enough to have created my own beverage ever I find Smart entrepreneurs and I partner with them and they're the ones who had the vision for the brand but I become the number one consiliary for them I'm going to give you an offer whoa Kitty going to give you an offer but the valuation is not what you going want it to be beverage is Savage as best thing you'll tell you I'll tell you it's Savage the mathematics for a company that this year has done 250 if we take it 12 months you're at 360 let's even round it up to $400,000 that puts you at a 1.6 odd million valuation for $400,000 for me to get interested it's got to be more 25% guys that is ridiculously good offer for you I would have never run aief in the night intriguing you you have to take [Music] that take it we

years craving Great South American food but we couldn't find authentic and convenient options in the market and that is why we decided to create toasted a brand of better for you Latin American food Staples that are ready to eat in under 10 minutes we decided to focus on a South American classic Thea it is a cornmeal bread that is crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside and perfect for stuffing with your favorite fillings we offer different flavors from Chia flax seed to Yuka to our original corn recipe all with zero added sugars and trans fats with three to four grams of protein

can do anything with you can stuff it with all different fillings or you can top it as a toast is that kept refrigerated or Frozen our products are frozen but are you already in stores this is real packaging you already on shelves cor we are currently in about 900 stores including Publix Walmart we recently got distribution at Whole Foods Markets and wind Dixie all the Central Market in Texas wow tell us a little bit about your background we're both originally from Venezuela we mentioned with sisters we moved to the states about 80 years ago because of the political and social turmoil that the country is still currently facing and looking for better opportunities for ourselves we worked hard to get a good education and start our corporate careers here I started working one of the largest cpg companies in the US and my sister started her career in the banking industry but there was something or a feeling between the two of us we were missing a part of our culture and our traditions and specifically our food and we started thinking between the two of us what we could innovate and we started experimenting with recipes in our own homes while keeping our full-time jobs we came up with with the first skiu which is the traditional ARA that is ready to toast in 5 minutes did you have any background in manufacturing Foods at all nothing we knew nothing what do you sell them for how much do you make them for what's the revenue let's talkn last year were 200,000 this year we've made about 190,000 in 5 months you think you'll get to 400 this year we're going to get about to 500,000 by the end of this year we sell them for 323 is Blended of the four skus it cost us 230 our gross margins are 30% after a little light a little light on the gross margins after selling and distribution expenses is 20% that's not good enough what are you going to what are you going to do to fix that packaging we already have a deal to reduce packaging by half and in ingredients there's a lot of opportunity to bring cost down and do you have competition not in the Frozen aisle there are other areas sitting in the in the in the refrigerated aisle I the product I got to tell you why I'm not a diabetic but I monitor my glucose I I wanted to try this root one it didn't spike it I found a bread I can eat thank you for bringing that up that's amazing this is a solution for me and lots of other people that diet the way I do we don't eat gluten and The Taste is phenomenal thank you I love to invest I love to invest in stuff that I use I I I don't know how you're going to make any money with these crummy margins this is the first year that we're going to be profitable but have you paid yourselves anything no that's the thing we haven't been paying ourselves look it's a flyer I'll give you the 100 Grand I want [Music] 20% there's only one Mr wonderful thank God for that but Mr Wonderful you're cting a valuation by one you're valuing at 500,000 I know that and that's what we're going to make this year it's unfair to Val time sales Mak sense to me for a commodity guys I'll simplify things to help you figure things out look it's a great product getting to 200,000 sales with the distribution you have from where you've started is phenomenal it's not something that I get excited about even though the product is amazing for those Reasons I'm out

retailers in the shortest amount of time it's fantastic thank you Lori I tasted it it's delicious but it's not the business for me this deal I am out but I'm not worried about you you're fantastic what is your path for improving your margins because to Mr Wonderful's point it's the more you grow the more you're digging a hole and with a 33% margin you're not going to be able to run a viable business have you thought about what you're going to do we are attacking it at different F funds one is the Machinery that we bought that's going to help us optimize our production proc esses second

date is 3.1 million wow are you making or losing money we are profitable here today we're at 4 465,000 good for what did you do last year in sales last year in sale 3.6 million and we did one 145,000 how much is going to direct consumer how much through traditional pet retail our biggest channel is the online marketplaces 70% is Amazon and chewy com Walmark and then 20 24% is retail remaining is direct to Consumer it's a small amount direct to Consumer from your site yes correct now I ask you this because it was a famous deal here in Shark Tank called base Paws for cats it's not famous famous he's never heard of it have you heard of Base Paws yes the exit was huge but it all they wanted was the data that was it how much did you raise I raised a million dollars and I put a million dollars myself in it your own money where did you get the million dollars to put in I had an exit I sold company five years ago how much did you sell it for $9 million what a you will never never guess what it was dog food no I started an online blog about soap operas no no no that's crazy The American Dream Baby were you a huge fan no no at that time I was flipping content website I knew how to start a blog Drive traffic from SEO building communities on social media you've been successful what what the plan for this business yeah I want to build and scale this business and then sell it to strategic our competitor that you saw on TV was sold for a lot of money to how much is it lot what is out there in the news is $1 billion W same L how big did they get to they must have had the customer information there's 110 million cats in America yeah and that's a valuable database of users they buy a lot of stuff my gosh we're back to the datab get you the database Kevin but what's the plan tell us your plan we have two new products coming out one is a brand new nobody is selling it it's a health indicating topper you can sprinkle that on top of your existing cat litter and then it will change its color same our litter what's the second product it's a same concept as a health indicating doggy peep hat it changes color if potential issues with the pH Ramon I I want to tell you I think you're such an impressive man but this is not a space that I understand enough about and the idea of this competitor that's already had the big fat exit cast a little bit of a shadow over me I I hope you do with this but I'm out of this one it's not for me you're wonderful congratulations to what you've accomplished but it's not a business I want to be in for those Reasons I'm out listen Lori and I been talking about this this may be one of these cases where two sharks are better than one in terms of driving awareness of this product here's the deal we want 10% of the company for $250 but we want a $2 royalty until we get back a million bucks and then it goes away we'll do everything in our power to get more customers buying direct because that's where the exit value is Extreme royalty deals are yeah I don't think it's in the best interest for the compan exactly Ramon but if you believe in me then why not Equity Kevin only believes in money a lot more Equity maybe a lot more Equity look I think that director consumer is great I think it's always going to be a proportion of your business I got to tell you most people still buy their products in pet stores are you going to go away from retail no no not away you don't have to give up retail but when you get a direct relationship it's far more valuable all here's an alternative offer the first one's on the table but we've talked yes we've meowed a bit together and we'll do all equity for 20% 10 each and we go to work for you 20% yeah we that's ridiculous what does the cat think the cat is not happy o is not happy to give up that much Equity at this stage why would you even start the business yeah jly since he's profitable exactly I'll give you the 250,000 for 10% I can help you go faster in retail we can help you online I think think it's the offer for you you got to pay more for two sharks what about three sharks watch your counter for three sharks for three sharks I can do I can do 10% whoops I'll do that deal on my own that's what he offered I know yeah that's what I offer but now we have Lor and Kevin we have a higher chance of succeeding rone mate don't lose your deal why not 15 I would do it at 15 I think

we'll figure that out if we're going to be successful it won't matter Ron you're killing me because I came in here with four now we are at 15 that's why they call it the shark to I know it's you had a deal for 10 you didn't want that why are we talking about 2% 250,000 15% sh you came in asking for 4% I'm tired of this I'll do 250 for8 but you got say yes or no now w wow I want in on that I'm not

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a product designed to help you get a grip on athletic performance. [Music] Hello Sharks. My name is Greg and I'm James. We are seeking a strategic partner and also $400,000 for 4% equity in our company. Hello James. What do all athletes need to perform at their peak? Three things, Greg. They need focus, training, and grip. , did you throw that? You guys have insurance for that, ? , . Grip. Grip is something we all take for granted. It's breathing. But what if we told you there was a revolutionary material that could alter performance outcomes in virtually any sport? Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement technology used to absorb oil on the skin and it's used for athletes, the military, and everyday uses that once applied absorbs oil in the skin that creates the slip in grip. Our grip solution is made from a unique but - tested material that's non-toxic, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, works even after being underwater, and is the first significant innovation in grip technology in nearly 70 years. We want a shark to come up and try it with us. Rashan. , how about you come up and try chocolates? Go get them, Rashan. Here, let's give you a try on the torque test. We'll see how you do. , here, step over here, please. . All . What I'm going to ask you to do when I say start is you're going to grab that metal bar and you're going to rotate it backwards as hard as you can. ? , our patent pending piece of equipment measures the amount of torque you're able to generate before your grip starts to slip. Got it? , let me push the start button. All . . Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. , excellent. All . , that there you maxed out about 14 pounds. You ever seen anything that? Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. , what we're going to do is we're going to put a single dose of chocolates on your hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. , we spring salt. You can barely see it. You can barely see it. You sprink it on. Now, put the other hand on top. . And grind them together. What you're doing, you're you're stripping away all the oil in your skin that makes it slippery between the cracks up. Yep. Once you're done, you clap away any residual material. And we're gonna do it again. , it's light. , you can barely feel anything. Let's see what happens. my god. Yeah, you tipped over the machine. Nice job. All , we'll see here. , that there, even with the machine tipping, which was your peak, you lost some of it there, you were still a 60% improvement in the overall torque you're able to generate once you got rid of that slippery component to your grip. Honestly, it didn't move at all. , it's it almost feels chalk, but more permanent almost. It's nothing chalk to be technically correct. That's why they call it chalk compared to chalk. What's the main difference? the main difference here is we're a subtractive material. we're trying to remove something. It's the oil on your skin that causes the problem. Let's talk sales. sales sales for this year thus far have been 740,000. Wow. here's the thing. Grip, no one thought about it, ? if no one's thinking about their grip, there's a huge marketplace for us in the grip. That's not true. Athletes deal with it. Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss deal with it. that's not nobody. No. What by nobody is the masses. , LeBron James, , LeBron James would benefit from our products much you cannot imagine. Then we don't want him to have it. Is this illegal in the NBA? No. Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, and fitness. And fitness is huge for us now. Yeah. And how much are you selling them for? , , this bottle here is $35.99. It's about 100 doses. And then the smaller one on display up here is $24.99. And how much does it cost you to make it? We prefer to have that discussion offline. Shark. How are we going to make a determination? We have and we have respectfully we have a supply chain. We make 67% margin on our product. you don't want us to work backwards, ? If you say you have 67% blended margins, then they know the fact that you gave us your blended margins but wouldn't tell us your cost annoyed the out of me. I'm out. Yeah. Thank Thank you. appreciate your honesty. How do you feel about it, Mark? Yeah. Yeah. , is there anything proprietary about it? , yes, there is. , we have two patents issued and two more pending for what? , for the material itself and the use of grip for the packaging and dispensing of the material and then also its use on different implements such as balls. Are you engineers? Are you What did you used to do? I'm a corrosion engineer by training. I'm involved with every major architectural firm in the country that gets involved with paint or coatings for high-rise structures, for nuclear power plants, for nuclear submarines. And what about you? , my full-time job is entirely chockless. My background was chemical engineering. How did you get your customers to come to you in the first place? That's our biggest problem. . If someone asks us what's your biggest challenge because that's why you're here, ? That's why we're here. much . is primarily for a strategic partnership to make our product know people know that we exist. Once they touch this product, they're sold. Hey guys, I I agree with you. I was getting ready to say that I'm a financial investor. I look to add accelerant to stuff that's growing fast. I do think it's a good fit for someone, but unfortunately not for me. I'm out. . No, thank you. Thank you, James and Greg. I can't even think of one thing I could do for you. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I have to get excited about what I invest in. And it's not in my wheelhouse, this this thing. It's a great product for you guys. It's not for me. , I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. The only way I can do this deals with a royalty because the valuation is nuts. It's $10 million. It's crazy. , I give you the $400,000. I want $2.50 a unit. And I I'll take that until I make back $4 million in revenue. Then it drops down to nothing. 25 cents in perpetuity and I get the 4%. And then I turn on my entire social media team to try and get your CAC down, your oz up, cuz I'm completely incentivized to sell as much as I can as fast as I can. It's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. That's why they call me Mr. Wonderful. It's the only offer it sounds you're going to get here. All . I don't think we should do it. They're not going to do it. There's no way that they're going to do it. Kevin, that's such a good deal. If you want me to come in with you to take your bases down, I'm telling you I would take a 100red or 200 of that if you want it. You want to do 200 of it? Sure. Same terms. I'm not changing my terms. The terms you outlined, I would do that deal. , yeah, we'll split it 50/50. I can get this in hands as he can with a bunch of athletes and we can figure that part of it out. before you say anything, Rashan wants to come into the deal with me. , you're going to get two sharks. Going to split. Lucky day. , two 200,000 each term stay the same. And I can get this in the hands of 20 to 30 athletes as I'm sure most of us here can easily. Rashan can get a lot of these guys, which I . That's why I wanted as my partner. , you think they'll talk about it. Will they be willing to state that they're using the product? I think if we opened another round in the future and we gave them the opportunity to have to invest and be equity investors as opposed to brand ambassadors. Yes, you can't afford to have them as as marketing guys because they're too expensive. But they love talking about what they are. it's two sharks. I go crazy on social. He does his connections and professional athletes. I think it's the best offer you're going to get here today. And by the way, zero flexibility. What do you think of the offer? I think we'll take it. Yay. All . You're a wise man. You're a wise man. You're a smart guy. That's a great deal. Listen. I I think that's great. I know. Can't even let go. I'm excited about that. I think we can help you guys. appreciate it. We got to get this in as many people's hands as possible. Send these small packages to 100 athletes. Let them come begging us after. Thank you. Thank you guys. It was nice to meet you all. Congratulations, guys.

anti does smell great yeah the beauty of our product we've Incorporated it into an activity of daily living that everybody does everybody woke up this morning and they shower why not do it in a therapeutic way that promotes soft tissue Health why therapy work the scientific answer is an increased what's called fi blast proliferation which leads to collagen synthesis all that means is it's encouraging tissue remodeling tissue regeneration what is this that's a polycarbonate tool called sore tool pro and what's great about is you could put it in your pocket go for a run you get a cramp you get sore you could use that what is your background guys I grew up playing sports my whole life I found myself in the trainer's room I grew in affinity for the Health Science field got my

second there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think it's going to be

the soul mender we're seeking $75,000 in exchange for 10% of our company now sharks as a teenager I know a thing or two about foot pain you see I get up at 5:00 a.m. for school and after a long day of AP classes I shoot over to the robotics lab after which I come home to tent my hydroponic garden after all this my dogs are barking and I think all you guys can relate after a long day at work we need something portable that can give us quick foot relief I invented the soul mender an Innovative new treatment solution to help alleviate foot pain now miss corkran when you were first starting out as a waitress I would imagine that you would have experienced some foot pain would you mind coming up and giving the if I get some massage out of it exactly come on over we have a seat set up for you here good and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull the Frozen roller out of the freezer real quick nice we have this guy here which is our Frozen roller and we're going to take this and we're going to put it in the base now it's as simple as rolling your foot on the soul mender and we recommend 10 to 15 minutes twice a day is it cold still cold it's not only cold it's instantly my foot relaxes shocking and what it's doing wow wow I do feel refreshed it does it feels great doesn't it thank you for that what the soul mener is doing is it has a stainless steel roller with a proprietary gel pack inside what it's doing is it's combining cold and Massage Therapy into one easy to use device now sharks who's ready to help us mend some Souls I have some samples for you guys if you want to check them out they are cold you can try they're cold they are frozen and then there's a piece of packaging there you can check out how that runs as nice than you much thank you Ian thank you what it's going to do is it's going to reduce inflammation and it's also going to help repair micro tears in the tendons that run along the bottom of your foot yes how old are you wow I'm 17 wow wow planner fasciitis I see that's on the box can you explain what this is and why this helps it what planner fasciitis is is where you get microt tears and the tendons that run along the bottom of your foot and unfortunately 2 million people per year get this condition and my mom was one of those 2 million people I hated seeing her in pain I figured there's got to be a way to help her out and it turns out that doctors recommend freezing a water bottle and rolling your foot on it but if you've ever Frozen a water bottle it has the tendency to explode every once in a while I figured there's got to be a better way to help people alleviate their foot pain but also be simple and easy to use I came up with the soul mender and what happened was I brought it to my dad and he is a little bit of an expert compared to me on planner fasciitis and why is dad an expert I'm an internal medicine physician been doing a for about 20 years his mom my wife is a rheumatologist she does arthritis muscular skeletal disease and forth he came up to this with us with this idea and we said it sounds great but it's got to been done wasn't done we use marbles the mass use Mar people use marbles people use coffee cans people use golf balls I think I have your first client I played with a guy named rro who's going to go straight into the Hall of Fame and every day for about an hour he would sit there in front of his locker and do this for 45 minutes and then he went out and got four hits every night wait what was he doing what on on the on I was wondering what are your sales we've done $25,000 in under a year and it's been a lot of me going door too talking to all these different people but we've been fortunate that 11 stores are excited about the soul matter and excited about young entrepreneurs and all of that have they reordered them from you yes we will get a reorder depending on how sales are on the season every one to two weeks and what are you selling them for I don't think you gave us a price yeah they're sold for $39.99 wow that's they cost to make now landed cost is under $10 but if we can get 25,000 units we can get down to $6.80 landed here the biggest challenge for this deal to me is how do I find the people that have the highest propensity to buy it to get my customer acquisition cost down because not everybody wants this or needs it but the people that do need it want it two million people have planed fast sh two million two million year I I want to talk about you a little bit because I don't want to bury the headline the fact that you're 17 years old when I was 10-year-old boy I had two dreams I wanted to be a major league baseball player and I wanted to be a CEO of a major company what is it that you want to do when you grew up I'll real quick start out with this moment here has been one of the greatest moments of my life honestly I've watched Shark Tank since I was 8 years old not yet Ian I true true true what grade are you in I'm going into senior Year where are you going to school for college I'm not sure yet if I can get the soul mendor to where I need it to be I'm 100% committed to the soul M no bad idea bad idea Ian that's a bad idea and I'm going to tell you why learning accounting learning Finance learning marketing the more you can pull together the quicker you can make decisions the more competitive you can be the greater there the Dilemma who's going to be run run soul mener you can run this off the net and you're smart enough to hire somebody to go to all the doctor's offices and grow it from there learn learn learn learn the greatest competitive Advantage is knowledge and what we used to say the only way out of the hood is to hit home runs or get an education I want to get down to the core issue what do that could help any shark help you acquire those customers I give you $75,000 task one is Get Me 2 into a retail store what do people do when they have foot pain they run into their Pharmacy and they say he in retail stores already I want to sell it online all yeah I what are you doing online Ian we do have our online website customer acquisition online is the whole deal I got it that's what's missing in this presentation and I don't know that answer for me it's an unknown that's what was missing and for that reason I'm out Ian I think you as a presenter are phenomenal I think your product itself lacks sex appeal it doesn't hook me in I love you but I'm out thank you I think that you will go far for me this isn't the product for me I'm sorry I'm out remind me a lot of me I my earliest memories are repackaging baseball cards and selling them you have that same type of Drive but I would be devastated if you didn't go to college now you can do all this out of your dorm room and that's what I did as I learned things in college I applied them to different business ideas and I got better and smarter and I had created greater advantages for myself I think you have to get there first then it becomes investable but for those reasons now I'm out Mr Rodriguez we M Rodriguez please we need to work with somebody who can get us to the next Lev we see the sports Market as a big market for this to be honest and I'm conflicted because I am one that invest in Jockeys not horses and you're the ultimate jockey but at this point is too small of a business and because I feel that you should be going to college that's what exactly what I would tell my two daughters for that reason I'm out thank you e\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** St Louis, Missouri (GPE), 75,000, 25,000,

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nnext up is a more stylish way to enjoy your [Music] lunch hi sharks my name is Ali kinety I'm the founder of modern picnic and I'm here seeking $400,000 in exchange for 6.5% of my company as a young professional working in New York City I would go into the office every day trying to look feel and do my best but when it came to packing lunch my options were unprofessional and definitely not stylish sure I could use a brown paper bag but my mom doesn't pack my lunch anymore and a plastic bag definitely not sustainable or functional or I could carry something this but I wouldn't be caught dead carrying this into the office sharks the outdated lunchbox needed a makeover I gave it one meet modern picnic fashionable insulated vegan leather lunch boxes you can bring your food wherever you go and no one would ever know what to lunchbox and we launched with our first product the luncher which as you can see here Chic functional and clean with the easily wipable interior to protect against those everyday spills but that's not all since we've launched we've since come out with the range of different shapes and sizes for all of your meal prep needs whether that be our toad or backpack because sometimes bigger is better our snacker perfect for the little things or our newly launched food containers designed to fit perfectly inside sharks who's ready to ditch those childish lunchboxes in those wasteful paper and plastic bags with modern picnic I hope you guys are hungry because I packed your lunch today in front of you you're some of our bestselling products let's open it up and see what's inside clever alley super cool what are you going to do to the per snatching industry cuz when they steal this expecting to find jewels in it you're going to find a ham and Ry in here it's a great idea I think it's worth 30 I was 22 years old when I came up with the idea for modern picnic and was able to successfully launch a company within 2 years with absolutely no prior experience connections funding highlighting my ability to make things happen not only myself but most importantly the company figure things out good for you how old are you now I'm 29 amazing and what do they cost what do you sell them for they range our aovs $155 we call ourselves attainable luxury you guys will love this our product margins are EX excellent averaging in the ' 80s landed duties paid it drops down to the 70s and gross margin it's a healthy 60 give us a dollar amount for this yeah the little one what do you sell it for what is that is around 30 35 what what you sell it for 159 wow allly the issue is you can't sell this in retail because people are going to compare it to purses not understanding the vision of The Lunchbox it's all online now while our e-commerce direct a consumer business accounts to the majority of our Revenue what's the majority 70% we started going wholesale this year and it's already accounted for 20% of our sales we are now sold in Sachs we launched in The Container Store and this morning good I got my vendor number for Bloomingdales which I think is a sign you're asking for a 6.15 million yes valuation you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business we've done under $6 million in cumul of sales from over 40,000 units sold what year did you start we launched in 2018 and what will you do this year we're projected to do over 2 million in sales this year and how much will you make this year we're projected to lose under $100,000 in sales why are you not profitable where are you spending the money the money's got to be going somewhere because if you're you said you're going to do how much this year over 2 million and you've got 60% margins that's 1.2 million in gross margin cont contribution where's that 1.2 million go yeah and in terms of how we're acquiring customers in recent years we've created an emphasis on having a healthy Diversified marketing mix we do affiliate marketing Tik Tok email SMS we have a optimized website but there's definitely I love how excited you are I want to go back to Mark's question yeah 1.2 million in gross margin where did that money go how much did you spend on Advertising about 25% of our revenue is going towards marketing that's where it is Ally I'm still trying to wrap my head around how you're spending money now if 25% of your costs are going is that digital marketing and you're spending additional money in brand marketing that's correct what is the total cost of marketing when you look at that 1.2 what is the total cost of markings it's not 25 it's much more than that yeah it and that's why we're how much I would say it's probably 50% on total marketing that's it's too much on marketing yeah way too much because that's that's where all your money is going it's you are way overpaying to find customers now and that's why you're not putting enough money on the bottom line because your margins are pretty good for this type of product your margins are amazing you're you're overpaying to acquire customers now do you have investors as I mentioned food strapped the company for a couple of years shipping out of my parents garage they're you got to get out and in 2020 I knew I had to raise some capital I had absolutely no idea what it meant to raise capital I went out and cold Outreach to 1,300 investors my ended up raising $900,000 what yeah we currently have a seed round proper seed round open which we've raised an additional 900,000 for you've raised the first 900 plus another 900 Ellie let me take a crack at this I applaud you on what you've achieved here and your presentation was almost flawless until we got into the numbers you're spending much money trying to build a brand and I have zero interest in funding a brand in fashion that is hard to do and pretty soon you're going to figure out that's not a good Pursuit I'm out thank you much yeah allly I would say you need to have more confidence in yourself and your product and I know that sounds counterintuitive but when you're spending much on Advertising that's typically because the entrepreneur is afraid that sales might fall we're afraid there won't be the demand there if you stop you're having to go out and raise money you have to be disciplined to spend less yeah it's not for me I'm out allly you're a Dynamo great presentation Kevin said I don't think the numbers work now I'm sorry I'm out thank you what I don't love is when a young company does many raises fast for much money I'm a big believer in you make money you roll it back in and I'm sorry I'm out yeah thank you shipping out of my parents garage we had to raise some money because we had to move out and we had to make some changes we were putting zero dollars into marketing the first three years in the garage and that's why we raised that that's you said it yourself go back to those times yeah I think one of the biggest lessons that I learned when I started good American and let me tell you I had two different sets of investors I had the old guys and the young guys the young guys said to me spend spend spend chase that Topline growth and the old guys said to me you're going to need profit when the tid's turn you have to think about running and that is lucky I was I'm going to listen to these old guys cuz they look richer and they've done more business and I think about this all the time it is a curse of many young Founders that I know that they have plowed much money into the belief that digital marketing coupled brand marketing and spending these huge percentages is leading to all of these sales but never ever looking at the fundamentals of the business what I will say to you and what I've seen in my own experience if you look at whatever you're spending on meta on Facebook on Tik Tok in any other platforms you start winding it down I'm telling you I I almost guarantee it you will not see a difference in your sales I think you're amazing I love the products I'll be a customer but for those Reasons I'm out good luck Ally we wish you all the best thank you thank you for sharing this with us today.\n\nNLP

What's in Urban Outfitters? Our baby collection. And then Love Club will be going in next. How many urban outfitters are you in? All of them. How did you get that done? One year flat. They came to us because we have a strong social following. and we work with all these major influencers. What type of influencers? Bloggers, celebrities. We reach over 200,000 followers, but our influencers have over 50 million. How do the sales break down, Hillary? What are the total sales?

All of it now mostly is in retail. how long has that been? It's been 3 4 months. That's much better than 400,000 a year. Those are stock. We're thinking 400,000 a year. It's been 400,000 in 3 4 months. Correct. . Only at that one chain, Urban Outfitters, now cuz we gave them exclusivity. And that's why we're here that I can exclusivity. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. No other retailer can carry,000 in but it's also continuing. we have POS all the way up to summer 2017. And Hillary, out of all these items, are there one or two that are that are the biggest sellers? Yes. our babe hat, which one? This here, our babe hat, this is our number one seller.

I thought babe was insulting to a young woman today. No, it's empowering. are you. , I why? Nobody ever calls you that anymore. It's a good thing. Now, did they buy all those hats from Urban Outfitters or did you sell direct? , we we sold it all to Urban Outfitters because we had to give them an exclusive. , you can't even sell this hat online.

You've got a big bet with Urban Outfitters. It's too risky. I'm out. Incredibly impressive sales in a , short amount of time. What's the bigger plan? Are you going to sell online? Are you going to go to other retailers? The bigger plan is to build out our direct to consumer. We want to build out that app where it's that video shopping app making it extremely simple for people to to watch and shop all in one place. You're asking for $500,000 on a baby baby business. It's way too much money for me to have confidence to give you that dough. It doesn't make any sense. There's no room for a partner in this deal now. , I'm out. , we're on track for 1.2 this year. Listen, I have a big dream to make this happen.

You have a major retailer, cool, popular retailer, and you're in and they've already given you big purchase orders and you've already proven your success. I think you should try to keep making things and funneling it to them. Have them keep expanding you. I don't see this as an investment for me now because my I have a completely different thought on on the way that you should go. , I'm out, but I'd be a customer. You're cool. Great way to start a business, but you have to change your entire strategy. And that's what you need the money for. For 500,000, I want a little more proof. I wish there was more data.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext into the tank is a product that provides an ice cold beverage exactly when you want it. [Music] Sharks, my name is Alexander Simone. I'm an inventor from San Francisco. I'm here today seeking $100,000 as an investment for 5% of my company, Pronto Concepts. My invention solves a problem that millions of wine lovers all over the world face every day. Wine lovers love their wine chilled. They also love their wine in the moment. But the best spontaneous beverage, ironically, requires the most preparation and foresight. That's why I invented Pronto Bev. [Music] Behold the world's fastest wine chiller. As soon as you pour any bottle into Prontov, the winegrade stainless steel interior jumpst starts a rapid heat transfer process. Simules or wine experts recommend that each variety of wine be chilled to its own specific temperature, which truly unlocks the flavors within. Prontov's built-in thermometer monitors your wine, you get that perfect temperature every single time. ProntoBev can chill a bottle up to 20\u00b0 in 30 seconds. Before Prontov, the only way to choose from your wine collection and enjoy immediately was to own a wine refrigerator. , there we have it. Perfectly chilled wine. , Sharks, when it comes to your wine and when it comes to your money, will you be waiting around or do you need it pronto? All . All . Mub, you to come up and check out the before and after version? I do. Come on up. And to let , , this prototype is not food grade, but it should be safe. I drink from it all the time. I said, it should be safe. Is it cold, Kevin? It's , beyond chilled. It's It's cold. Is it the temperature? It's the temperature for a white. Could I have some wine, please? I'll be your server. , continue. Drink out of that. Damon, do you want a glass? Please. Thank you, Mark. Sure, why not? . Thank you. All , Mr. John, do you, Mr. Cuban? , you were saying you don't have the one here, ? . , is this not even in production yet? It's not in production yet. What's the material that holds the temperature delta? Behind the stainless steel is our trade secret pronto gel. Is that patented? We have a provisional patent on it. Yes. . How did you come up with this idea? I was back in college trying to drink a bottle of wine with a girl and the wine was warm. me being the inventor type, I grabbed a pasta strainer. I filled it with ice, poured the wine through and amazingly the wine was super cold super fast and we go to drink the wine and it was horribly disgusting. When you did that, you also diluted the white ruin. Yeah. that that is a huge issue in chilling white wines. This doesn't dilute it, which is a good thing. And I know that because I'm a member of the Chevier test and we care about the temperature of our wines. Drink to the Chev. [Music] . , can you tell us where you're at with sales? Yes. , we finished our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign yesterday and we raised $54,000. What were you looking for? 25,000. And what does it cost on crowdfunding? It's $89. When we're selling it, we'll sell it for $129. Whoa. Cost us $22 to make. , if you're positioning this product as a wine chiller, , why do you have to put it back in the bottle? The way we can get it to chill quickly, it is a cannon blast of cold. You're saying it freezes if you leave it inside it? It won't freeze, but the temperature will keep dropping. With any alcoholic drink, there's a perfect temperature. And to let , all of the temperatures are written on the packaging. Thank you much. , you seem to know a lot about wine. What's your background? I studied entrepreneurship. Where at? At Arizona State. I came up with this idea. I said, I've worked for other startups in the past, but I've known my entire life that I was going to do something this. , I have no idea why people aren't going over this valuation. , let's look at the crowdfunding platform you're on. You only sold $54,000 worth in two months. The first two months. Do you have some other stuff that's going to give us a reason to get to a $2 million valuation? There is another reason. , one of our biggest competitors, they're also a wine chiller, but they take way longer and there are other drawbacks to the product that Prontov has a lot of advantages over. What does the competition cost? What does it cost? They charge $80. They're doing how much in business? 10 to 20 million a year. 10 to 20. That's a big big swing. But you believe that that's why you're worth $2 million. I see our products as being worth far more than that. You've been watching Shark Tank. Where did we go wrong? Why do you think we would ever invest in a company at this level with a $2 million evaluation? This company has only one direction to go and that's up. , then I failed you because I obviously am not giving the lessons here and the information because I don't want you to go into another room and make a stupid mistake that. Valuation is crazy. I'm out. . One of the challenges I have in working with inventors, when you're an inventor first and an entrepreneur second, you want to invent, but the harder part is turning into a company that's profitable enough to make it worthwhile. Valuing this company at $2 million. I don't see that. I don't see it going there. And for those reasons, I'm out. , that hurts. Mark, we've been a great partner. Alexander, look, , a great product that you're passionate about doesn't make a great company. And your evaluation isn't trivial. It's way too soon for me. , I I'm out, but I I think the only person that would be interested would be a wine expert. What do you call a wine expert? A a great reason to toast. , Alexander, I don't care what you think it's worth. All , I know the challenges of getting into the wine business. There is tons of competition and little of it proprietary, but I see the merit of it. I would use it. There's more good news. I'm going to make you an offer and it's the only offer I'm going to make. Not going to negotiate. , you've got to be kidding me. I'm going to go and give you $100,000. I want 50%. [Music] why? Cuz you don't know what you don't know. And you need somebody to endorse this and help you get it out there. Hey, but this this prize is all Hold on. I have some good news and some bad news. What do you want first? , give me the bad news first. Bad news first. I'm out. Lori, what's the good news from that? I'll tell you the good news. The good news is I think you have something clever and I think that it has merit. I went out because I think that there's a lot of time and education and learning and tweaking for you to get to a price point that I think will be a hero. But I do think you have the potential to get there and you have a member of the Listen, Alexander, you do have an offer. What do you want to do? There's no way I have any flexibility. I've been doing this my whole life. Yeah. And you can't give up 50% of your company. I'm It's not a company. Alexander's discussion with Kevin. Kevin, if if I gave you 50% of my company, ? It would be doomed from that moment. Why? Because I need equity to play around with I can 50% is Is there a better partner than me? Is there 20%. No, I No, no, no, no. I take you out of the wastelands, the darkness. I bring you to the light. Darkness. , that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. You have a high probability of making money versus you walk out the door with without a deal and you are dead to me I won't even remember this thing. I'm willing to negotiate but I need to keep some equity for myself cuz I should have 101 I can go and raise the other 100,000. I have interested people in other 100,000. Look, if you had come more advanced with sell through and proven sales, that's different. I would have given you more credit and maybe had flexibility. You have none of those things. , Kevin, are you stuck at the 50%. I said at the beginning, Robert, I have no flexibility. Give him 200,000 or 250,000. Give him the extraund,000. How do I raise the money, Kevin? If you're in my partner, I this needs to happen. Where am I going to get the other 100? I get diluted, too. , maybe I'll go in on that round. Maybe I'll put more money into it. , he owes less than 50%. It's not his company anymore. That's crying a river, Mark. Yes or no, Alexander. And you won't budge it off cuz you're giving me no wiggle room here. It's binary. Yes or no. This is your moment. You decide. What's your next product, Alexander? Our next product is a martini. What are you talking to him for? He's already out that that chills martinis. the problem with the martini business is to get into the martini side of it and to do this and get it out. You need another $100,000, ? How are you going to get the other hundred? We have people who are interested, but I know I can get the other$100,000. I know I can. I'll give you $100,000 for 25% contingent that you raise the other 100. Yeah. Done. Thank you. You got to work your ass. I will. I will. I will.

My name is Zach and I'm from a small town outside of Dallas, Texas. I'm seeking $350,000 in exchange for 15% of my company, Permapug. Sharks, picture this. You get home from a long day of work. You finally get comfy in bed or on the couch. Your phone's on 1%, you reach for your charger. Wait, where is it? It's missing again. , what could you do to try to fix this? Maybe you could try a sticky note. Zach's charger. Do not move. Use extra bold lettering and exclamation points to make sure that they know you're serious this time. Maybe you could buy dozens of cheap chargers every few weeks and hope there's one around when you need it. Maybe you could even try supergluing your charger directly to the outlet. I'm kidding. Do not try this at home. But somehow someway that charger will still end up getting borrowed but never returned. This is a daily dilemma for millions, but not for those who've been lucky enough to discover. The permlug charger lock. Permoplug charger lock is a proprietary fully patented locking system that secures your charger and cables into place they can't be moved, stolen, or accidentally unplugged. Let me show you how it works. First, you'll simply remove your existing outlet cover. Assemble your permlug system, which includes the locking cover, a dual fast charger, and up to two charging cables. Then, you'll place the permlug charger lock directly on your upper outlet. And then you'll screw it back in using the included standard screw. Or you can upgrade to a security screw for added protection. And boom. Start charging without ever worrying about your charger or the cables growing legs and going missing again. Zach, honey, sweetie poopsy baby. Wait, let him finish. , you're not done. I know you're excited. I am, too. Good job. Phones, headphones, tablets, and other devices are a crucial part of our everyday lives. They're not going anywhere. Protecting the lifeline of these devices is a no-brainer. , Sharks, who's ready to secure your chargers and a deal with Permablug? Good job. Oopsie baby. The issue is this solves the problem in your home, but if you're in a hotel or on the road, it's not practical, ? It's for permanence unless you're the hotel. It depends. The hotel would be the one that purchased them from us. And there is a ton of unique applications in commercial settings. , that's an interesting point. You're saying the hotel can then do that that they provide it for their guest. Guests don't take them away or even their staff in the background. Yeah. I do not deserve to rip you to pieces if you have sales. . Do you have any? I do. I have about $2,000 in sales. . I am now going in sales far today. I have $456,000 in sales a year to date. That's a good answer. That's a great answer. That'll go down in Shark Tank history there. How did you get 450,000 in sales? I brought the sales in all myself. , I originally filed the patent for this in 2019. , it goes all the way back to whenever I was a kid. I grew up with cousins. We all grew up on the same street. We always stole each other's chargers. And then in 2019, I went and stayed at a friend's house. And when I stayed at his house, I slept on his couch and I had my phone plugged in to his charger. It was super glued to his outlet. , light bulbs flipped and I knew this was a good product and brought it to life. This is for anybody that has one child or more. I got three teenagers. It happens by the minute. How are you selling it today? The 450,000. , by the way, is that for the year? That's year to date. I'm 665,000 lifetime, which is 12 months last year. Who are you selling it to? Fully direct to consumer. My customers range all over the place. , parents tired of their kids moving the charger, siblings, roommates, and a huge one now is schools. They're buying them they can charge the tablets for their kids. social all through social media. All on your website or Amazon. , Amazon's a huge channel for me and I was resistant to doing that at first, but it's 60% of my revenue is Amazon now. And I don't love that because I don't own the customer data. You guys know how that is. But I incentivize people to try to buy on my website with better pricing. Are you buying a lot of ads? Most of my marketing is organic. I do have a retargeting funnel set up I can retarget the people that have engaged with my organic. Yeah, good for you. , and I'm I have a SEO background. , I built all of these automation tools using automation and AI. , for instance, if I'm talking to somebody and they say, , what's the best Father's Day gift for 2024? I can text myself that, generate a blog post, make sure her a plug is number one Father's Day present automatically published on my site and indexed by Google. I want to go back to this 350,000 15%. What are you going to do with the 350? I I'll use it to help increase my flow. , I've got a decent amount of money in the bank, but I am playing cat and mouse a little bit with inventory buying cash flow in the bank. What's the container? I have about 80,000 worth of inventory now. that's that's a lot. That's my hard cost, but I'm selling 15,000 units, I'm I'm moving them pretty quickly. You're making any money on the 465,000 you're Absolutely. My margins around 58%. what do you put in your pocket? And what do you sell it for? I'm I buy those for about 650 each and I sell them for about $35 on average. Do your customer acquisition cost in the last few months? They're they're less than 15 bucks because I'm only doing warm retargeting. that have not engaged intent intently with one of my organic videos. It cost you 15 bucks to acquire a customer and the average order size it's around $58. All . Look, I I thought this was a joke. I got to be honest with you, Zach. Obviously, sales say no. And you you sound credible. here's an offer for you. I'll do the 350%. I want two bucks a unit in royalties in perpetuity. I'm curious who's on your team. How much? you. This is all me and my wife. We have a 24-hour fulfillment promise notice. We're up till midnight packing orders. Doing everything. It's your full-time job. Yep. And do you have any debt? Do you own it 100%. I own it 100%. Zero debt. , I am doing this full-time now. I'm living off of my savings for now. I don't plan to take any profit or salary from the company until 2025 to make sure that I have enough float for the company and there's enough inventory and I'm not fighting with paying myself for that. , I've saved up enough from my job to live off of until then, but I do plan on, , obviously taking a modest salary next year. Good for you, man. , everybody I meet wants to be successful, but few people are willing to make the sacrifice and pay the price. We've made a ton of sacrifices, too, honestly. , , we've, my wife especially, she's put in tons of work with me. She doesn't have to do any of that. She's got two full-time jobs taking care of a three and a halfyear-old and a 2 and 1/2month-old now. , and she's out there grinding with me. I'm I'm here now and she's at home packing orders. back. What's your reaction to Mr. Wonderful's not wonderful offer? , I I figured coming in here I may get an offer something that. I would not be open to a perpetuity deal, but I would be open to giving a royalty to anybody for that matter until your money's paid back because I don't borrowing money. Zack, why is that interesting to an investor? Because I give you my money, I put it at risk, I wait two and a half to three years to get it back. I make nothing on it. Could be sitting in the bank making 5.24%. The only other value is an exit on the value of the patent, which may or may not play out. , you're putting your largest investor at 100% risk. , I'll give you your $350,000 for 25%. No royalty. . If you don't mind me asking, what does that put the valuation at? 1.4.4. . He's doing 1.4. I have good news and I have bad news. What do you want first? , that's for the bad news. It's I'm a delayed gratification type of guy, I'll go bad news first. Always get the bad news first. There you go. Always. Want to know the good news? That's the good news. Yes, ma'am. I'm back in. . Goodness. . My next question was going I I had to do that to you for your whole what you did to us. Yes. 2000. I thought you'd appreciate that. , I'm going to offer you 350,000. I would 20%. . And I'd a royalty of $1 until I get paid back my money because I think together it'll be a powerhouse. That's my offer. All . That's a great offer. What are you going to do? Thank you. Here's my thing. I'm Kevin. I didn't I didn't think it was real. I thought you were That is true. You were negligible at best. But congratulations. I you're you're doing great. it's not for me. Yes, sir. I'm out. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Yeah, Zack. I'm in the same boat. It's a great product, but , SEO already, , maybe some cash flow things. You got this on lockdown and it, ? , yeah, it's not a fit for me. , for those reasons, I'm out. . You have three offers. She's got the best offer on the table. , no, she's not Mr. Wonderful. What does that mean? , it means what it is. I did my research on all this. You guys on the table, I am also the best partner for you. I I grew up not caring about being an athlete. I didn't look up to any athletes. I didn't look up to any actors or anything. I looked up to people you guys. , I know everything about all of you and I know what you've done with companies and you and everything you guys have all done is extremely motivational.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] First in the tank is a winter sport accessory that is functional and fashionable. [Music] Hi Sharks. My name is Kelly and I'm Christina. We're from San Francisco, California and today we're seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10% equity of our company Yard Sale. Sharks, if you've ever skied, you probably agree with us. Ski poles suck. They're clunky and easy to drop. Plus, they're made of cheap materials. They come in limited colors. And I think we can all agree they're pretty ugly. We're lifelong skiers and know firsthand that people are constantly looking to upgrade their ski gear. But when it comes to innovation, ski poles have been , long forgotten. That's why we started Yard Sale. Yardell ski poles blend clever design and great style for the everyday skier. The best part about yard sale poles, they're magnetic. We've hidden magnets in the handles in the basket that they stick together, making walking to and from the car or getting on and off the lift an even easier experience. Skiers love how yard sale poles are fully modular you can mix and match between the five eye-catching colors on our website to create your own custom pair. With Yardell, we're not only making ski days easier and more fun, but we're creating a lifestyle brand for the millions of recreational skiers out there. , Sharks, who's ready to ditch your old poles in the snow and ride the chairlifts with Yard Sale? , I love it. I got to ask name. Yes. Why the name yard sale? . Haven't you ever had a yard sale on the mountain? , yeah. Kendra, are you what? Are you a black diamond skier? You don't know what a yard sale is? It's when you lose everything. Your skis come off, your poles come off. It's they call it , , a yard sale, a garage sale. , does everybody that skis know that? Because it's an it's an insider term. Kendra clearly is a skier in the room and clearly I've had a lot of yard sales and it goes a bit back to the origin stories of how we came up with the idea. Christina had a infamous epic yard sale or wipeout and that's where she came up with the idea. I had a bad yard sale. It got me thinking about my greatest frustration with the product, which for me is when you're carrying them, they're always crossing over, they're falling down. And I thought, why has nobody put magnets on ski poles? And are you the only one doing this? Yes, we are. I started tinkering with my old poles and I taped some magnets to the handles of these. I walked around the corner to Kelly's house cuz he lives close by to me and I asked him what he thought. No one has ever in decades rethought the humble ski pole. Yet every skier needs them to ski. What are your backgrounds? I've always been passionate about design and I was fortunate to follow that pursuit to MIT where I studied mechanical engineering and product design. afterwards I worked at Apple as a product designer across various teams and as an avid skier I was ready to jump into a consumer product. are you guys full-time in this? We are. We are. Yeah. my background is more on the marketing side of things. After college I worked for a hardware tech startup in marketing and then I transitioned to the venture capital side where I was the head of content and PR for a VC firm in San Francisco. One of the most important things to note as is that over 60% of our customers online customize their polls which means that we have a huge adoption. You're not doing any retail, ? , we are in a few specialty stores. , what's your price compared to a regular pull off? Absolutely. , we launched 6 months ago. , and we make the product for about $30. We landed it for 42 and we sell it for$1 139. It's 75% margin. What are the average poles? Great question. We're in the upper middle range in the market. , on the lower end, you have about $50, $60 poles, which are cheap aluminum ones, but on the upper end, you have advanced poles, but we sit in the middle. And there's other pools that are, , in our range, but no one that offers features we do. What have you sold far? Yeah, great question. Yep. In the first month, before the holidays this past year, we did $100,000 in sales in our first month. , we are fiscal year to date, , $220,000 in sales. 220. Yes. And we are forecasting to end the year, which for us ends in September, at $300,000. Next year, we're forecasting $2.1 million. Where and how did you sell them? Yeah. , we we launched DTOC only. , we'll be expanding into retail next winter with with who? , what was exciting is in our first 30 days, we had REI reach out to us backountry decathlon in Europe. When I get new poles, I'm in the boots in the store and we're sizing and the, , we're trying to figure out exact, , the pose, ? , what happens to you? Those are a little do you need multiple different sizes of this inventory? They they come in five sizes. , but that's that's an inventory nightmare. , we've got an answer for you, Mr. Wonderful. What you can see in our kids poles, which are on the far left here, is that they're adjustable. And we'll have adjustable poles for adults next year as . , wait, you mean they'll continue to slide? Yeah. , , as kids grow, they'll grow with kids from ages 10 to 22. By the way, I don't see that out there. Let me tell you how I feel. , first of all, I don't love the name. I think it has a bit of a negative connotation and an incorrect connotation for a premium quality brand new item that's innovative. Yard sale feels it's a disaster and it's when the worst thing happens and then I'm not a skier and have to feel passionate about the product. Love the people but don't feel it here. , I'm sorry I'm out. Thank you much. I love the name. when I saw a fubu they were what is a fubu Italian? Is it Japanese? Is it number three that on the poo poo platter? What is it? And that exactly became a conversation that stood out from everybody. how many times people come up here, their name is too close to something else and then they spend a lot of money and they lose it. They I will say it is one of the biggest reasons skiers have paid attention to our brand. I agree. I'm part of the the snowboarder community and we hate you guys. I don't know. I don't skiing. this is not for me. I wish you all the best. Great innovation. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you, Damon. I've never skied once in my entire life and I have no intention of starting. , for those reasons, I'm out. I love this. I love the name. This is great. It's catchy, but , you're early. This is 6 months in. You're putting a $2 million valuation on a business with what you're asking. And we realized there's a high risk behind that. And , , one of the things that we did was we we, , are obviously asking for $200,000 for 10%. , but we do have a lot of profit margin in our product. And therefore, we do have a bit of a secondary offer in our back pocket, which Mr. Wonder say, Mr. Wonderful, we'd love to talk to you about. , if you're willing, we'd love to make you an offer of $200,000 for 5% with a $3 royalty until you recoup your initial investment of $2,000. That's the first time a company has ever offered to Kevin a royalty. A royalty. , afraid of a royalty. That's the first. I would prefer to model it this way. , I'll do the 200,000 for 20% and I'll take my chances on distributions. I want a distribution when you distribute to yourselves, but I want I want to wet my beak on this one. I want 20%. Yeah. , yes, absolutely. We'd love to talk about what Kevin would have to do to roll up his sleeves and help us. , , I don't want a job. . , you said you need somebody who's going to roll your sleeves up. Honey, I've done it. I get retail. I get omni channel. I think you have a great direct to consumer, but wholesale is where you can build this business. That's how I started, Kendra Scott. I I'm going to do 20% as , plus I want the $3 back until I recoup my 200K. . Thank you. All . The difference here is I do think I can help you with this wholesale strategy. I'll drop my ass to 15%. But I'll take the $3 royalty till I get back 400,000. , it's a 2x. Would you be interested in doing $200,000 for 8%, we'll drop that equity down, but we'll increase your royalty to $5 a unit until you recoup $300,000. We'll do it at 10%. I want the royalty, but I want a 2x on it. . That's going to put us in a tight position in the future. , we think at five at $5 a unit, we can get you your 300K back if you we'll take that offer within under two years. Getting my money back is not not why I do deals. I want to get a multiple audit. Kendra, would you be interested in that a royalty offer, which is $200,000 for 8% with a $5 unit royalty until you recoup $300,000 back? what? I that. I that. I do it. Can we do 10% and you have yourself a deal? If you'll drop to 250 on the royalty payback, you got yourself a deal. 300. my god. $50,000 cash. Come on. Pay off the upfront cash to $250,000 at 10% with a $5 royalty until you recoup $300,000 back. Done. Done. Let's go. I'm going to come over here. I'm skiing over. Thank you much. Thank you, Kendra. Thank you much. much fun. I'm going to have these everywhere I go. Thank you much. excited. Thank you all. You skis deserve each other.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First, first (ORDINAL), San Francisco, California, VC (GPE), poles, Italian, Japanese (NORP), Europe (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** yard sale, ski poles, a yard sale, a lot, the product, the name, a royalty, san francisco\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 blend: design\n  \u2022 create: custom pair\n  \u2022 create: lifestyle brand\n  \u2022 love: it\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 call: it\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 rethink: ski pole\n  \u2022 follow: pursuit\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.14)\n\n**Topics:** sale, pole, yard, royalty, skier",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext into the tank is a business that aspires to make unmanned flight accessible for everyone. Hi, I'm JD Clarage. And I'm Charles Manning. Our company is XCraft. We're looking to seek $500,000 in exchange for 20% of the company. Much when the Wright brothers first took flight in 1903, we're witnessing a new dawn of aviation, the age of unmanned flight. The X+1 is a drone redefined. We've combined both the hovering precision of a helicopter and the fast flight of an aircraft. You can soar at speeds of up to 60 mph and climb as high as 10,000 ft. Wa! And you can seamlessly transition from high speed back to hover. How cool. XCraft is breaking boundaries and with your help, the sky will no longer be the limit. JD, how is it different from all the traditional drones I can buy today? , the fundamental difference is the ability to transition to forward flight. And it does that with a wing. This is the wing here. This this this main area is the wing. . , , , it's hovering and then when you want to go into forward flight, it rotates that. Now, it's an airplane. Why do I care the fact that I can go much faster? You can capture a fastoving subject a car or, , a motorcycle or something that. What's the range on this? Because if it's going 60 m an hour, , you would have to probably be in a helicopter to accompany it, ? Or or you can be stationary. You can be stationary. Yeah. , it definitely it's maneuverable, you can stay within visual range. But one key part is that this system can run entirely autonomously. You can build a flight plan on a c on a on a software system on a PC and have it go do those things and come back. Charles, am I allowed to create a flight plan for an unmanned drone and lay it out there? Yes, that's a good question, Robert. There there are regulations and and rules now and and primarily if you're flying for recreational purposes, you need to keep it within line of sight. Stay away from other aircraft and airports, ? as as personal property. And then you can't fly any higher than 400 feet. How much does it cost you to make? it cost us $400 to make it. And what do you sell it for? It retails now for $1,800. Have you sold any? Yeah, we've got $173,000 now in pre-sales. And that's Kickstarter then? yes, Kickstarter was $143,000 and then we've done about 30,000 cents on our website. Guys, what's your what's your background? Are you engineers or? Yeah. , I have worked an aerospace engineer by trade. I started out of school and worked at Oracle and I've been in software my whole history. I was looking at some drones yesterday because I have a property with 36 acres and I want to buy something cuz I'm getting a designation of managed forest and one of my responsibilities is to scan it every year to look for diseased trees. , I'm going to buy a drone. Can I configure the camera on a gyroscope below it that I can film from below? Cuz I have to turn it into airplane mode to use that camera the way you've got it configured. We're working on it now that we can hover it invert it and , there's more. Yeah. , this is called phone drone. A what? Phone drone. Phone drone. Bingo. , we can use our smartphones for all different sorts of things today. That's great. But never have we been able to allow our smartphones to fly until now. I love this stuff. And we have a little video that we can show you. Sure. We love to see that. my god. , that is cool. And do you use the sensors in the phone to do the balance and everything? Exactly. We do. yeah, smartphones today have, , gyros and accelerometers. they've got GPS. They've got a lot of them have decent cameras. that's all the expensive components in a drone. we've leveraged that and turned a smartphone into a drone. How much does this one cost to make and how much do you sell it for? This is not currently for sale. This is in development. What do you think it will cost? we're looking at around a price point retail of $300. Probably less than $100 to make. Jade, answer this for me. Where's the secret sauce in your company? tell me what somebody can't knock off. You what it is? It's about the IP behind the designs. The IP behind this design is unique. The IP behind this design is unique and also patent pending. What we believe is that there is completely opportunity around the designs. We're going to license this thing. Silly. It was sick to my ears. And do you have the ability or the contacts to go out and license yourself? , we do. then I I'm trying to figure out why are you here? You're asking for 500,000. What are you going to use that money for? 250,000 we would to use for scaling production on the X+1 to get our costs down. , inventory and then the other 250,000 is to finish development of phone drone. . , look, what value are you looking? I've heard enough. I'd to make you an offer. I'd to start things out here because you I've been looking at this market a bit for the last month and I think you have some issues around licensing I could help you with, but I think you need more money. I'm going to give you 750,000 for 25%. And Kevin coming into the Cuban zone. No royalty, no nothing. I was straight up turned over a new leaf each day and the Grinch's heart that day. 750,000 for 25%. Wow, guys. He increased your value to 3 million bucks. I appreciate that. what I smell? I smell a nasty nasty shark fight. It's about to happen. I'll offer you a million dollars for 25%. I'll I'll raise mine to a million as because I'll give you a million for 20%. What? Damn. Yeah. , your value doubled. All . I'll do the same thing. A million for 20%. Wait, slow down. Slow down. Hang on. Maybe we should go step out in the hall. We should all go step out in the hall. Before you step out in the hall, we contemplated this as an opportunity and it's a fantastic opportunity. We believe everything is about team. That's why we are a good team. Talk better. , let me unpack this. I want to do a team deal because I know that there's a big nasty vulture somewhere here being quiet. , if you guys want to talk about what he's going to say, here's my suggestion. Is there capacity to do a syndicate where we get each and every one of you participating in your own unique ways? , I'm interested in that. I'm interested. I'm interested in that. For what value? That's rare in the Shark Tank. I need enough equity to make a difference. Charles, what would you say that dollar is for you and the equity? , I think a 10 million valuation. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, how did you go from 2.5 million to 10 million? I smell greedy people now. , I used to tell my daughter this this little story. Why didn't the baby crab want to share his food? And the answer is because he was a little shelfish, ? I I can't counter for everybody here, but I don't I don't think this is worth more than $6 million. I don't believe. , he back. He got a ceiling, and that's helpful. I think that ceiling for me is 5%. I got to have 5% minimum. That's the smallest position I've got in anything that I'm working hard on. , let me ask a qualifying question. Is there anyone of you that is not interested in participating because that will help address that problem pretty quickly. I I'm interested. I see a lot of oil and gas security, all kinds of applications for I'm interested. I'm interested. Are you all , I don't know. Mark's not saying he hasn't said. We'll see. I think it'd be good. Let's step out the chat. . All . Thank you. want you guys to be clear. There's a lot of privacy issues. This isn't a slam dunk. It's your call. I think we should try to get them all at a 6 million valuation for 25%. If there's five of us, simple math. We each have to put up 300,000. Mark, I don't know. What's your reservation, Mark? I don't know. I want to hear what they have to say. All . We're excited. We're mostly excited about doing something together. . Do you have something to propose to us? We do. Yes. We would We would to propose $1.5 million each at 5% equity and bring all the sharks in. You're willing to give up 25% of the company. We each put up 300,000 for 5% 25% total. That gives you a $6 million valuation. I'm with this deal. I'm one shark. I would do that deal. I'm with that deal. I'm with that deal as . , Robert, then I'm in on that deal, too. Mark, what are you doing? You guys are smart. Did anybody else offer you money prior to this? For sure. . Yeah. And when someone's come to you, what were the discussions? There's two categories of conversations. One is strategic and one is pseudo institutional. A lot of the institutional guys want to shape it a early stage VC structure, not something we're as excited about doing. You all have a lot more operational execution experience, respectfully, than many traditional early stage VC guys. And you also cover a spectrum. You cover a variety of different areas, which is useful to the business cuz that's the whole model. Charles, I think that's smart. I deal with a lot of VC guys we all do. And I got to tell you, they're all super smart. They're all great theory, but they don't get their hands dirty in running businesses. That makes a lot of sense. All , Mark, are you in? That works. All , guys. I'm excited. I'm excited. We should do a special party where we do a little flight party. Absolutely. We got a Shark Tank syndicate. Can you believe it? You guys are going to own this market. Thank you guys. Thank you. We're thrilled. All . done.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 20%, 25%, 5% (PERCENT), first (ORDINAL), 1903, today, yesterday, the last month, that day (DATE), up to 60 mph, higher than 400 feet, 36 acres (QUANTITY), 60 m an hour (TIME), Kickstarter, VC (GPE), Cuban (NORP)\n\n**Key Phrases:** a lot, a drone, phone drone, you guys, that deal, the ip, the hall, unmanned flight\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 witness: dawn\n  \u2022 combine: precision\n  \u2022 break: boundaries\n  \u2022 do: that\n  \u2022 care: fact\n  \u2022 capture: fastoving\n  \u2022 build: flight plan\n  \u2022 create: flight plan\n  \u2022 fly: feet\n  \u2022 cost: you\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.13)\n\n**Topics:** guy, drone, flight, lot, deal",

construction company but for artists that's a great description and are you taking a commission or Comm no they're they're hourly give me an example want eight that mural how much do you charge me for that something that 8 by 8 would be around 15,000 15,000,000 how many days would it take to do that about 3 days what are you paying them they start at 16 an hour is it typically one artist working on your 8 by8 or how many around two two if you're paying them $15 an hour to start and they're working a 10hour day that's 150 * 2 300 a day time 3 to 4 days 1,200 and you're charging 15K and is all that margin or what other costs are associated with that we try to estimate when we do our bidding we try to keep it at a 40 to 50% needs in this calendar year what are your revenues going to be we're projected to land at 800,000 yeah what are you going to make on the 800 about 100 and that's after paying yourself though that's I pay myself only around 23 how do you live on 23,000 in a city me it's interesting I did have to go through the eating the bread sandwiches I I I ended up leaving fit and lived on the couch in the Bronx in a bad neighborhood but you can now afford to give yourself more than that afford to live myself I live five blocks away from the office cuz I work 17 hours a day I have no time to commute obviously there's nothing proprietary about what you're doing but the margins look good they're good what do you need the $300,000 for I have a three-step plan for that $300,000 step one I want to launch in a few more cities and then any of the extra funds used for marketing as as our dispatching system that we have I want to make a customized one special for our needs who else are you competing with we have few competitors that would take on a $115,000 mural our other competitors that are in the media space they won't touch a job under 50k look Emily it's a great business the challenge I have is scaling it to be big enough as a owner operator you could grow to $2 million make hopefully a million dollars and put it in your pocket and that's great I I I'd have a hard time seeing how I could help you get to 5 10 $20 million as as proud I am and excited for you as I am for those Reasons I'm out thank you much Mark it's tough for me it's impressive I think the personal issue that I have is the my highest turnover has always been my Graphic and Design Department because artists is artists I love their talent I wish I could do that but it's challenge with me working with them I've been burning much this is not for me I'm out thank you Damon it's an impressive story you dropped out of high school and now you've got an $800,000 business it's an unusual deal Emily it's hot now though everybody wants a mural after you see me you're going to be looking around and be this everywhere you are strong and resourceful sometimes the strongest swords are forged in the hottest fires if you're thinking of going out I will be seriously the hardest work you'll ever meet I understand the industry more than anyone else backwards and forwards I've grown this from the ground up I've grown this for $12 an hour to 1.4 million in sales to date and that's only counted at 2 and a half years I'm on my game I want to grow this much all look you're you're a funky chicken Emily it's crazy it's a different deal it's look I'll do the 300,000 for 35% I'm not sure about this business I'm 100% sure about you I think that Kevin's offers a good offer a little aggressive I'd to beat him up for you and get him to come down in his percentage go back to that I'm funky but I don't think it's for me I'm sorry I'm out thank you Lori Barbara if you need any clarification in relation to what Lori said I'm more than happy to talk you through it I think the key to the business is twofold one you're artist you've got that covered the other piece is the client relationship the Big Ed agencies the smaller agencies I think there's much more depth in the client Market to sell to what disturbs me is that you focused on doing a small business again somewhere else versus taking roots and making a big ass business out of it what what would you suggest then suggest you not worry about it and let me tell you why I remember when I was building my New York City based brokerage firm I had a phenomenal client who moved to Connecticut with all their corporate Executives and I thought I was prudent in following them out there and opening a big office I lost my shirt but more importantly my core business stopped growing for almost 2 years because of that stupid Sidewinder I didn't realize the depth of the New York City Market market for me to build my business by 100 fold and that's what I focused on I do want to make you an offer you don't get in bed with this creepy guy cuz that would be a mistake cuz there's nothing he could do for your business I'll give you the $100,000 of the 300 as cash and I'll give you a $200,000 line of credit that's the only way the numbers make sense for 15% I was going to as 20 but I want to save you from this character it you wouldn't him to do business with there's only one Mr Wonderful I'm going to stick with my offer I I I'm I'm comfortable with it if I if I take your offer you're a partner of mine I value everything that you want what do you see for what happens next I think what you have to do is give more depth to your sales line which is you you're all over the place from what you said I think you're mostly an administrator at this point what a waste of your talent I completely agree I can teach you how to structure your business where it makes optimal sense of your talent would you suggest a sales team I would say a sales team no I bet you most of your business is coming to you versus you going out for it correct that means there's a lot of business to be had anybody who listens to you is going to fall in love with you I would have never guessed got two offers I got to tell you at the beginning of what do you want to [Music] do bar you got a de thank you much done done I know that I know love you for.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 15%, 8 by8, 40 to 50%, 35%, 100% (PERCENT),

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext up is an entrepreneur on a mission to preserve one of Earth's most overlooked resources. [Music] Hi Sharks, my name is Paige Hansen. I'm seeking $250,000 for 10% of my company. I'm here today because our earth is in crisis, a soil crisis. Sharks. Soil is a precious resource, but intensive monoculture farming is depleting it, stripping its nutrients and biodiversity along the way, leaving us with soil that can look this. But sharks, there is another option. Soil that is rich, healthy, and thriving. All we need to do is increase demand for crops that improve the soil naturally. Luckily, I know the crop. Buckwheat. Buckwheat is a seed, not wheat. And farmers love this crop because it naturally regenerates even the most ravaged soil. It suppresses weeds, prevents erosion, and attracts beneficial pollinators. Let's give this crop its moment in the sun that it deserves. Introducing Bam Buckwheat milk. Our milks are deliciously creamy and slightly nutty. They're organic, gluten-free, dairyf free, a complete protein loaded with antioxidants and magnesium. , who's ready to invest in the cream of the climate smart crop? Sharks, in front of you, we have our samples of bambuckwheat milk for you to try and also some ways for you to enjoy them. , we have three skews. Original, hint of vanilla, and extra creamy. And then the ways to try them are a smoothie, a vegan chocolate pudding, and an iced coffee. , I tried the hint of vanilla. What did you think? It's nice. I can taste the buckwheaty taste. when you drink oat milk, you get the oat milk. This is not But it doesn't taste milk. It's a good taste. I taste something. It's light. I it, but I don't. It's light. It's almond milk. It reminds me of how almond milk is but it's water. It's super watery, but I it. The smoothie is good. Now, Paige, don't take this the wrong way, but in Burgundy, when we look at some high-end wines, I'm a member of the Chevier Test and we look for what's called the barnyard nose. ? In other words, translates for French into pig. And I'm getting a little bit of that barnyard nose in this. , I know, Mr. Wonderful, that that everyone has different pallets. And buckwheat does have an earthier note to it. , when you think about the plant-based milk market, first of all, this is a $2.9 billion market in the US. 43% of US households regularly purchase plant-based milk. It has a 70 I'm sorry, I keep looking at your face, Mr. Wonderful. Don't look at it. Do not what it's hurt all of us for all these years. That's his normal face. I worked hard to keep this product super clean. When you drink those oat milks that have become popular, the main ingredient after oats and water is oil. It's oil. ? Yes. Usually the second ingredient. Let's talk about the economics of your business. 250,000 10% a 2.5 million valuation. I'm going to assume you've got some people buying this stuff. Yeah. I launched in November of last year. I'm new to market. I'm based in San Diego and I launched with about 25 stores as a pilot test. . How much did you sell? , I've sold since November 17th of last year 50,000 lifetime sales. In March, I launched into Whole Foods Market. . , let's go through your margins. What it cost to make it. 294 landed per bottle. I sell it for $4.95 per bottle to my distributor. You'll find it on shelf anywhere from $8.29 to $10.99. I'm trying to do something called VC math where I'm trying to see if I can make money. What are your use of proceeds? , I'm not yet profitable even though I have that. I don't expect you to be. Yeah. Which is confident. I'm not Kevin. I'm not going to bash you for that. I want you to reinvest all the profit into growth. You can try. Yeah. , you can try. , tell me your use of proceeds first. Yes. , now, because it's me, I have outsourced a couple of positions. My distributor's outsourced. My co-man is outsourced. You need to hire some people internally. Yes. And what's your monthly burn? My monthly burn is about $12,000. , and now I've only raised a little bit of money. I funded this 100% with my savings. Yeah. Wow. Good for you. My mission is big. , a quick side note, because , female founders get 2% of VC money. And bad bad. See, see what happened? I was , what the hell happened? Let's see if we can change that today. Because, by the way, African-Americans get probably about the same or less. . True. Yeah. All . Less. Let's Let's hear it. Go ahead. I've only raised $250,000 to valuation. That was a $2.5 million valuation, which is part of the reason I'm explaining that today. That was a year ago and that was as a convertible note. A $2.5 million cap on a convertible note is not a valuation. That's where the note caps at and then it converts from debt to equity in the future. there's no real valuation. I haven't done a price. Borrowed money that converts. Got it. There's no price round. What? Last question. 2024 projections for this year. What is that? I'm projecting $200,000 in sales this year. Good for you. Good for you. Let me take a stab at it. Paige, look. I understand everything about your product now. I can't get behind it because I don't the way it tastes. Not for me. I'm out. , . Paige, I'm in the same boat. , your mission's great. You're great. I think you need to build a community because culture and soil is good, but that's hard to convey at retail. You've got to get build a community of -minded people who think the soil is more important than the price, more important than , I'll get used to the taste. That's what you've got to build. that's what you didn't bring in. And for those reasons, I'm out. . Sorry, Paige. Thank you. , Paige, I can see how hard you have worked on this. It's not the investment. , I wish you continued success, but I'm sorry. I'm out. Paige, this is the most critical time for a founder. And the earlier you ask for capital, the more it costs. And I'm going to have to give you a valuation where I'm asking for 20, 30, 40, 50. I don't think that it's the thing to do. You are too early for me, but you're in a great place for you. I wish you the best. I'm out. Thank you, Damon. I appreciate that. One thing that I want to mention also is I am launching with a big retailer in January. That's when my cost will drop 60%. my cost. Why did you bring that up earlier? Because I forgot because you're making many faces. You're great, Paige. Fed, you're great. You are. Paige, I'm here. , I am a active beverage investor. I was the first investor in Happy Viking, plant-based protein drink for women and I invested in Zen Water, Kasa Azul, Recover, and I know the beverage space extremely . When I come into a deal at this stage, . I love being the accelerant, not the spark. . because there's not a lot of spark here with the revenue and attraction. I can't do my thing yet, ? , for that reason, I'm out. Congratulations. Good luck today. Thank you much. Bye. You did a great job. Thank you. Of course, I was disappointed that I didn't get a deal, but honestly, I'm more motivated than ever. I think I captured the shark's attention, and it wasn't the time. It wasn't the fit. But Bamb Buckway Milk is here to stay. Damon, the percentage of women and minorities who raise venture capital. You brought up a good point. , every morning I wake up, I have 25 and I'm sure all you guys have this pitches from people who are trying to raise money from something. It's 99% men. I rarely see it work. what's interesting on Shark Tank? After 16 years, I don't. We don't have that problem with Shark Tank. It only is one thing. Can you make money? Why do you think I'm here? This is the best thing ever. You can sit here and get all the best deals.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Earth (LOC), French, African-Americans (NORP), first, second (ORDINAL), US, San Diego (GPE)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the way, the soil, this crop, almond milk, a little bit, some people, last year, your use\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 250,000\n  \u2022 be: option\n  \u2022 know: crop\n  \u2022 love: crop\n  \u2022 suppress: weeds\n  \u2022 give: moment\n  \u2022 introduce: Buckwheat Bam milk\n  \u2022 have: samples\n  \u2022 have: skews\n  \u2022 try: hint\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.24)\n\n**Topics:** milk, paige, soil, year, shark",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nVolgende is 'n plaasvervanger vir miljoene weggooigoed. Hallo Haaie. My naam is Dinesh Taripally, medestigter van Incredible Leads en Ek is van Planeet Aarde. Ek is hier om deel 7% van die ekwiteit van ons ongelooflike maatskappy vir $ 500,000. Haaie regoor die w\u00eareld, 'n verbysterende hoeveelheid mense is eet hul kos met eenmalig gebruik plastiek gereedskap. Maar hoekom gebruik ons iets net vir 'n paar minute as dit gaan honderde jare neem om te ontbind? Haaie. Dis 'n oomblik aan die linkerkant, maar 'n leeftyd op 'n stortingsterrein. Dit is hoekom ons met ongelooflike vorendag gekom het Eetgerei Die w\u00eareld se eerste mis vervaardigbare, Heeltemal eetbare eetgerei. Wow die haaie. Nou mag jy jou eet lepel, eet jou strooi, eet jou spork, en eet selfs jou eetstokkies. Het ek nodig S\u00ea meer? My vraag is nie wie wil nie bel\u00ea in ons, maar wie wil graag by ons aansluit red die planeet? Een strooi of een lepel op 'n slag. Goed, haaie, Probeer asseblief al ons eetgerei in verskillende geure met verskillende soorte kos. Wat eet ons Hier? Wie gee om? Ek gaan 'n spork eet. Dinesh. Hoe lank neem dit vir dit om ontbind? Ja bly elke lepel ferm vir tot 20 minute in warm sop soos 'n warm Kos en sowat 'n uur in 'n roomys. Hulle is dus redelik stabiel genoeg vir jy moet daarmee eet en dit dan eet Na. Dit is baie goed, dankie. Kalorie\u00eb per eetstokkie, eetstokkies ongeveer 15 kalorie\u00eb. Ek het een lepel hier en dit was fantasties Dit was soos 'n pittige pizza gegeur broodstokkies. Ek sou eintlik wou om dit te koop en te eet, selfs as die gereedskap. Toe was hierdie een in die roomys en hierdie een het 'n vanielje geur en dit smaak soos 'n wafel ke\u00ebl dit is heerlik. Dan het ons het hier wat is hierdie een wat 'n Strooi en wat is die geur? Dit is eintlik smaakloos, jy is bekommerd oor die geur van hierdie benewens hul funksionaliteit. Ons konsep is dus om dit te behou subtiel omdat ons aanvanklike. Eerste jaar van ons verkope is heeltemal gefokus op voedseldiens want dis waar die swaarste gebruik van plastiek is en hulle wou dit om baie subtiel te wees, nie te aanmatigend nie, want hulle wil nie die kos wat jy verander, verander nie eet met, nie waar nie? Wat kos dit vir jou om dit te maak? En waarvoor verkoop jy dit? Ongeveer $ 0.20 om die lepel en ons te koop Koste van goedere is $ 0.10. Wat kos differensiaal sou dit wees tussen baie groot volume plastieklepels teenoor hierdie eetbare lepel? Ja 'n plastieklepel neig om een tot twee sent per lepel, maar ons produk het die vermo\u00eb om maak addisionele winste aan die Maatskappy. Kom ons s\u00ea byvoorbeeld, 'n baie groot roomysketting bestel 100 miljoen lepels. As hulle verkoop dit aan hul verbruiker vir vyf sent, hulle maak 5 miljoen wins en ons maak ook wins. Maar wat sou dit doen? kos my as ek nie wou verkoop nie as 'n groot roomysmaatskappy? Ek het 100 miljoen hiervan gekoop. Wat is my delta? Wat is my verskil in prys? Ons het dus met $ 0.35 begin. Ons het reeds het dit tot $ 0.20 verlaag. Ons is gaan dit tot $ 0.15 verlaag. Dis duur, Ek dink. Maar het jy enigiets verkoop Nog? Ek het tot dusver 1,2 miljoen lepel verkoop, 2 tot 2 1/2 jaar. Wat is dit in Dollar? Wat, $ 170,000? En waar verkoop jy dit? Ja 2019, dit was heeltemal B2B-voedseldiens want dit is waar die meeste van die plastiek is. En dit gaan goed met ons. Ons het ongelooflike trekkrag gehad. En dan die COVID-treffer en dit is gegee geleentheid vir ons omdat ons kon verken B2C en direk aan die verbruiker. Ek het twee naweke deurgebring, ses boeke gelees, my eie verpakking ontwerp, my eie webwerf ontwerp. Jy doen nie weet wanneer jy dit sien dat dit is Eetbare. Niemand weet dit totdat jy Vertel hulle. Daar is dus 'n redelike bedrag van onderwys wat gaan moet Gebeur. En gaan hier na die kant van skaal, toe u oor 100 miljoen gepraat het stukke en ek is die roomys, wat dit ook al is, die B2B speel besigheid tot besigheid, Ek gaan myself moet afvra: wil ek $ 0.02 betaal vir die plastiek of wil ek 10 keer betaal meer hiervoor? En dan almal opvoed wat nie net kan jy die roomys eet, jy kan die lepel eet wat jy het dit mee opgeskep. Daar is baie werk daar. Goed Wag \u2019n minuut. As jy kreatief was, jy sal weet dat jy kan indruk en afdruk in die lepel en in elke stuk wat s\u00ea: maar wil ek 20 keer meer betaal of dit die teken het, eet my daarop of nie? 'n Kwessie lyk opgewonde om hier te wees Vandag. Ja. dit is my droom om wees hier. Ek is 'n immigrant uit Indi\u00eb, en ek werk nog steeds. En ek was druk dit van 7:00 tot 03:00 elke dag vir die afgelope twee en 'n half jaar. En ek voel trots dat ek verminder of vervang het 1,000, 000 plastiek gereedskap. En ek het gevind die doel van my lewe. Ek het die doel van my lewe. Dis wat maak my meer gelukkig. Daar is 100 miljoen plastiekgereedskap weggedoen elke liewe dag. En met ons patent en IP, Ons maatskappy gaan die planeet en die manier waarop mense hul eet Kos. OUKEI kom ons gaan terug na geld, want Dit is 'n ernstige stuk verandering. Ek sal jou baie graag wil ken Agtergrond. Ek is mal oor al hierdie goed oor, jy weet, hoe wonderlik is dit nie. Maar ek wil my h\u00ea geld, geld, geld, Geld. Kom ons hou op. Ek het teruggegaan na Geld Kevin. Dit is baie belangrik. Ek weet Geld is baie waardevol. . , Laurie, ek is in Indi\u00eb gebore, en my pa het my die waarde van inhoud en geluk. En hy het ges\u00ea geluk is hier, Nie hier nie. ek het na die VSA gekom vir my meesters en toe studeer ek. Ek het in 'n tegnologie begin werk maatskappy in die Baai. Meesters was in elektriese Ingenieurswese. Ek het besluit ek moet Sorg daarvoor, want my kinders toekoms is op die spel. Dit gaan nie oor soos ja geld is lekker, geld is goed om te h\u00ea, maar stel jou voor een roomysketting of een restaurantketting wat dit verander om eetgerei te eet en geld te maak. Dit gaan 'n omwenteling in die hele w\u00eareld. Jou entoesiasme is absoluut Heerlike maar ek voel dat jy verblind word deur jou eie entoesiasme. Ek dink jy vra baie van 'n restaurant om in die lepel te gaan verkoop ook besigheid en om te neem hul miskien een sent of selfs die helfte sent koste van hierdie kos en tot $ 0.20 per lepel. En dink ek jy het baie uitdagings daar wat is teen die norm en super kreatief, waarvoor ek jou prys, maar ek is nie seker of hulle prakties is nie genoeg om te vlieg. En vir di\u00e9 redes, ek is uit. Dinesh, Ek stem nie saam met Barbara daaroor nie Punt. En laat ek jou vertel hoekom dit passie is presies wat gaan laat jou slaag. Die rede hoekom ek is sukkel is jy weet, jy het nie bewys dat dit regtig cool konsep is skaalbaar vir die wys daarop dat Mister Wang wat ges\u00ea het: maar jy het evaluering toegereken, Dit is bewys dat dit skaalbaar is. Die gaping tussen jou visie en jou verwagtinge van ons as beleggers is weg na weg, weg, heeltemal te wyd. Ek moet dit evalueer nie as 'n droom nie, maar as 'n besigheid met $ 170, 000 in lewenslange verkope. Dit is nie die moeite werd nie Van $ 7.1 miljoen. Daniel Ek het niks aan bemarking bestee nie. Ek het 'n groot vermo\u00eb om te maak dit is noodsaaklik omdat dit 'n interessante produk. Ek het net spandeer twee jaar om die beste produk te maak wat daar is. Ek dink jy gaan om te wen, maar ek gaan nie inkom as 'n belegger hierdie dorp. Ek is jammer, maar ek is nie. Dankie dankie vir tyd. Ek bedoel regtig, ek bedoel, Ek wens regtig jy kan weer dink. Ek Beteken vir my is die idee briljant en ek lief vir ingenieurs en ek is seker jou reis het jou gebring na waar jy is want jy is passievol. Ek glo dit alles. Maar ek is soos Dani\u00ebl, verstik aan hierdie 7,1 miljoen Waardasie. Ek hou van jou maar daar is geen manier op aarde dat ek gee jou 'n halwe $ 1,000, 000 vir 7%. Jy het ges\u00ea jy kom van die planeet Aarde, Ek ook. U aanbiedings vir die planeet Zootron, dis die probleem maak nie sin nie. Ek sal jou die $ 500 gee, 000. Ek wil 35% van die onderneming h\u00ea. Dit gaan oor die regte ooreenkoms. Dankie vir die aanbod, Kevin. Jy het hierdie tipe spelwisselaar produk wat my myself laat afvra het, hoekom het ek nie daaraan gedink nie? Want dit maak volkome sin. Die briljantheid van wat jy doen buite die produk is dat elke enkellopend aanlyn en in die regte w\u00eareld baksteen- en mortieronderneming is altyd op soek na verkope wat is relevant vir die produk wat word daaronder verkoop. as jy 'n slaai, as jy roomys koop, As jy alles by 'n kruideniersware koop Winkel jy is reg langs die voorafverpakte Voedsel. En daar is dit. Wil jy die planeet en sit 'n strepieskode daarop en verkoop dit individueel? Jy verkoop dit net, reg? ek gaan vir jou 'n aanbod maak, maar dit gaan baie van my verg Tyd.

have excellent Vision underwater but it's not easy for everyone else and that is why we wear swimming goggles but most swimming goggles today are the leak are uncomfortable and it makes total sense of course they do all of our faces are different swimming gos are one siiz fits all and that is why we have created the world's first custom fitted swimming goggles wow it only takes 13 seconds to scan your face and we'll deliver the goggles directly to your doorstep our app based scanning technology ensures a perfectly fitting goggle with no leakage and no marks after use some of the world's best swimmers and triathletes they already wear our goggles but we want all swimmers to get a pair of our goggles and to accomplish that we seeking $500,000 for 25% of our company H wow sharks who wants to help create Magic shs in front of you you have two goggles you can try them on but they won't fit you because you haven't scanned your face we haven't been able to produce a pair of goggles for you have a look look at the part of the goggle that touches your face you can see that gasket is different from the two goggles that you have and that is our secret source and what do they sell for $55 they're dark that is for outdoor swimming we have ranges from super light one totally clear to dark and the design of the goggle means that you have a great peripheral view which is super useful you can navigate better how big is the goggle Market in the US and Europe $2.2 billion 2.2 billion I'm not suris I'm not surprised I have three young Sons they wear goggles all of their friends wear goggles but for a 20 million valuation I'm guessing you've already sold a lot of these yeah we have 40,000 customers far our lifetime revenue is 3 million when did you start we started in 2018 and we've been growing three times every year it's logical my glasses are made for me why have swimming goggles never been custom made we are a triathlete both of us I went on a vacation I forgot my goggles but I had to swim and then I purchased all the goggles that I could find none of them fit me then I called the best triathlete that I knew at the time that was rasos my nephew he's your nephew yes where are you from We're from Denmark I don't understand why you're only charging $55 why aren't these $99 we wanted to charge in the middle of the other highend goggles we didn't want price to be an issue for our customers what does it cost to make it it cost $14 and what is the customer acquisition cost that is $24 guys nobody comes in here asking for $500,000 for 22% that's always to protect your previous investors tell us how much money have you raised we've raised $1.5 million at what valuation the last valuation that we had was $9 million can you walk us through how the ramp has gone over let's say the last 3 years in 2018 when we delivered the first goggles our Revenue was 180 the year after was 370 last year it was 1.2 million wow and far this year we're at 1.5 impressive where are you based and where do you manufacture I moved to Charlotte and Rus moved to New York we convinced our wives to make the BET and move to the US why did you choose to move to the US Market here is better and the relative number of swimmers is slightly higher than Europe then you're manufacturing where is that done we get some of our parts from China and then all the customization happens in Charlotte North Carolina do you have any type of IP coverage we have a Utility Patent on the fitting algorithm you manufacture the goggles and you have to customize them to fit what is that process yeah we used Advanced robotics technology to do it are you using third party robotics or are you developing all the software are control the robot is of course made by us not all companies can make robotics Mark it's a goggle company not a robotics no it's a robotics company that makes goggles now exactly exactly look when you have a unique Niche and you're developing a new category it's not where you are it's where you'll be I'll offer you the $500,000 but I want 75% and I don't want you to negotiate with everybody cuz you already know that on you that means he doesn't want you to hear anything else if you're more concerned about that Equity the two of us have an offer you may find interesting guys I already have a robotics company that I'm an investor in I have ai companies I have machine learning companies I have AR companies and obviously being in the sports industry I have you may not want to give up 7 and a half% that's why if you if that's too much then I'll listen to a counter you have it let me give you an offer that two sharks want to give you and you can get both the sales and the technology how about this deal Venture debt deal 500,00 all between the two of us and we're going to charge you $3 a unit until we recoup 1.5 million then the royalty goes away but we're only going to ask for 5% equity and you get two sharks or Rasmus let me tell you my daughter was a world- class swimmer in fact she was ranked in the top 10 in the world in the butterfly when she was 12 years old I've spent 18 years at swimming pools I get this market I'll do 500,000 for 5% no royalty I want to say what you need are Partners with Mr Wonderful what you're going to get nothing nothing exactly nothing except for what will help you scale your business I've been the CEO of three different companies in Silicon Valley I know how to build extremely large audiences cost effectively you have an amazing product but now how are we going to bring it to the masses that's the problem that I've solved over the last 20 years not wait a minute you need somebody who will help you blast these out sell them I'm a product person I to blow up sales I to move fast and I to Blitz the market and that's what I'm good at Lori do you have an offer not going to offer you Tech but I'm going to offer you a lot of sales I have Mark and I have Robert who have both given you offers and they're on the tech end and I would join either one of them to blow up the sales I'm asking them do either if you want me to come in that was a good question but I think that it comes down to what were you hoping to get here today in the next short while do you need to boost sales do you need to boost strategy do you need to boost Tech guys guys we we've all been entrepreneurs and we know you can't choose you have to do both you need to generate sales and you need to answer the Strategic questions about how to best build the business business n has a fantastic track record doing this he

happy with the 5% how do we split that 5% guys we'll drop down 1% to be more competitive because we're asking for five we'll go to four we want that royalty structure in place but it's not Perpetual we get back our Capital it's not even that great return but we stay in the game you get three times the capital no we're only making a million bucks off 500,000 we're willing to go down on the equity and guys I said I'll listen to a counter offer and we have a counter and will we yeah Robert and I are going to do the 500,000 6% no royalty no royalty wasn't the offer five it was that was the first of us and now it gotten worse got worse by a percent but you get two sharks I'm happy to do 500 ,000 for 5% on my own I think Lori brings a tremendous amount of it that gives you the sales but we need

3% Equity now we're totally aligned with your existing shareholders if you think this company is going to be worth a lot the equity is where the real value is long term guys guys I got to get this

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a product designed to help you get a grip on athletic performance. [Music] Hello Sharks. My name is Greg and I'm James. We are seeking a strategic partner and also $400,000 for 4% equity in our company. Hello James. What do all athletes need to perform at their peak? Three things, Greg. They need focus, training, and grip. , did you throw that? You guys have insurance for that, ? , . Grip. Grip is something we all take for granted. It's breathing. But what if we told you there was a revolutionary material that could alter performance outcomes in virtually any sport? Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement technology used to absorb oil on the skin and it's used for athletes, the military, and everyday uses that once applied absorbs oil in the skin that creates the slip in grip. Our grip solution is made from a unique but - tested material that's non-toxic, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, works even after being underwater, and is the first significant innovation in grip technology in nearly 70 years. We want a shark to come up and try it with us. Rashan. , how about you come up and try chocolates? Go get them, Rashan. Here, let's give you a try on the torque test. We'll see how you do. , here, step over here, please. . All . What I'm going to ask you to do when I say start is you're going to grab that metal bar and you're going to rotate it backwards as hard as you can. ? , our patent pending piece of equipment measures the amount of torque you're able to generate before your grip starts to slip. Got it? , let me push the start button. All . . Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. , excellent. All . , that there you maxed out about 14 pounds. You ever seen anything that? Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. , what we're going to do is we're going to put a single dose of chocolates on your hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. , we spring salt. You can barely see it. You can barely see it. You sprink it on. Now, put the other hand on top. . And grind them together. What you're doing, you're you're stripping away all the oil in your skin that makes it slippery between the cracks up. Yep. Once you're done, you clap away any residual material. And we're gonna do it again. , it's light. , you can barely feel anything. Let's see what happens. my god. Yeah, you tipped over the machine. Nice job. All , we'll see here. , that there, even with the machine tipping, which was your peak, you lost some of it there, you were still a 60% improvement in the overall torque you're able to generate once you got rid of that slippery component to your grip. Honestly, it didn't move at all. , it's it almost feels chalk, but more permanent almost. It's nothing chalk to be technically correct. That's why they call it chalk compared to chalk. What's the main difference? the main difference here is we're a subtractive material. we're trying to remove something. It's the oil on your skin that causes the problem. Let's talk sales. sales sales for this year thus far have been 740,000. Wow. here's the thing. Grip, no one thought about it, ? if no one's thinking about their grip, there's a huge marketplace for us in the grip. That's not true. Athletes deal with it. Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss deal with it. that's not nobody. No. What by nobody is the masses. , LeBron James, , LeBron James would benefit from our products much you cannot imagine. Then we don't want him to have it. Is this illegal in the NBA? No. Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, and fitness. And fitness is huge for us now. Yeah. And how much are you selling them for? , , this bottle here is $35.99. It's about 100 doses. And then the smaller one on display up here is $24.99. And how much does it cost you to make it? We prefer to have that discussion offline. Shark. How are we going to make a determination? We have and we have respectfully we have a supply chain. We make 67% margin on our product. you don't want us to work backwards, ? If you say you have 67% blended margins, then they know the fact that you gave us your blended margins but wouldn't tell us your cost annoyed the out of me. I'm out. Yeah. Thank Thank you. appreciate your honesty. How do you feel about it, Mark? Yeah. Yeah. , is there anything proprietary about it? , yes, there is. , we have two patents issued and two more pending for what? , for the material itself and the use of grip for the packaging and dispensing of the material and then also its use on different implements such as balls. Are you engineers? Are you What did you used to do? I'm a corrosion engineer by training. I'm involved with every major architectural firm in the country that gets involved with paint or coatings for high-rise structures, for nuclear power plants, for nuclear submarines. And what about you? , my full-time job is entirely chockless. My background was chemical engineering. How did you get your customers to come to you in the first place? That's our biggest problem. . If someone asks us what's your biggest challenge because that's why you're here, ? That's why we're here. much . is primarily for a strategic partnership to make our product know people know that we exist. Once they touch this product, they're sold. Hey guys, I I agree with you. I was getting ready to say that I'm a financial investor. I look to add accelerant to stuff that's growing fast. I do think it's a good fit for someone, but unfortunately not for me. I'm out. . No, thank you. Thank you, James and Greg. I can't even think of one thing I could do for you. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I have to get excited about what I invest in. And it's not in my wheelhouse, this this thing. It's a great product for you guys. It's not for me. , I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. The only way I can do this deals with a royalty because the valuation is nuts. It's $10 million. It's crazy. , I give you the $400,000. I want $2.50 a unit. And I I'll take that until I make back $4 million in revenue. Then it drops down to nothing. 25 cents in perpetuity and I get the 4%. And then I turn on my entire social media team to try and get your CAC down, your oz up, cuz I'm completely incentivized to sell as much as I can as fast as I can. It's not a bad offer.

Going to split. Lucky day. , two 200,000 each term stay the same. And I can get this in the hands of 20 to 30 athletes as I'm sure most of us here can easily.

Jy mag nie weet nie Hierdie maar ek is eintlik Chef Wonderful. Ek het lemme gemaak deur Japannese kunstenaars wat eens samoerai swaarde gemaak het. My die duurste is nou $ 3500. Kevin jy het meer rommel in jou huis as wat ek dit eintlik skerp maak met 'n klip wat twee verskillende het digthede daarop. Maar ons sal jou Monsters. uit met die monsters en Ek dink, jy weet, ons wil 'n bietjie pret h\u00ea voordat ons begin praat oor die besigheid en regtig die emosie om dit te gebruik. Ek sal dit probeer. Is die handigste met 'n jagmes Soos buite? Ek sal doen. Ek sal buite doen. Fyn. Wat Ons wou illustreer hier is almal weet hoe dit sny as u 'n super skerp mes het en hoe maklik dit gaan. Moenie dit doen nie by die huis, Kevin, As jy met 'n dowwe mes sou begin, Ek wil h\u00ea jy moet deur die Pynappel. Het dit reg deur die Sentrum. Dit is baie moeilik om te doen met 'n dowwe nag. En jy sien, dit is nie baie lekker nie. jy is klaar. Dis die dowwe mes. Jy is klaar. OUKEI nou probeer ons die skerp mes. Jy moet die pynappel bestendig hou. En dan wil jy h\u00ea ek moet dit swiep? Ja, doen dit. Kyk na daardie oorwinning, Rohan. Neem die tou en jy vou dit in twee en jy vat die dowwe mes Eerste. Wat is die dowwe een? Die een wat nie skerp daarop s\u00ea nie, OUKEI. Jammer daaroor. Ek verdien daardie een. Hou dit 'n bietjie vas bietjie nader aan die tou daar sodat dit ontglip jou nie. Ja Dis nie. En hennep is baie moeilik om sny in elk geval. Nou moet ek met die skerp lessenaar gaan? O Ek sien. Ek bedoel, , Ek bespeur die aksente. Goed , Kom ons begin daar. Ek en Mark het getrek na die VSA om hierdie besigheid te begin. Ons het 'n geslaagde gebou w\u00eareldwyd handelsmerke en besighede. Waar het jy? beweeg hier van? Ek werk uit Swede. Beide. Ek is oorspronklik van Amerika. Ek het grootgeword in Swede. En verhuis na Amerika. OUKEI. En wat Was jou beste produk wat jy verkoop het? Ek het Happy Socks gestig. Gelukkige sokkies. Ek is mal daaroor. Ja. Ek was jy. Ja. Jy is steeds betrokke by Happy Sous? Ja Ek is. Maar ek is nie operasioneel nie Nie. Ek is op die raad en eienaar. Maar hoe het jy met die mes idee self? Ons het iets terug in ons land gesien dit was soortgelyk, maar na meer na die kommersi\u00eble kant. En ons dink oor hoekom word dit nie gedoen vir 'n verbruiker en vereenvoudig dit. Kry 'n Koevert Kry die messe in vaste prys. Vinnige Draai om. Hoeveel vra jy? gaan lei ons deur. Ons sou skerp gemiddeld $ 10 per mes vir alles ingesluit minimum pakket 4 messe. Maak dit saak die Grootte? Asof hulle getand is. Daar is een van die broodmes, jy weet, Dit is wat ons vereenvoudig het. Die tradisionele lewenswinkel is in 'n boere mark. Hulle sal duim gaan en hulle vra anders. Ons het het dit baie eenvoudig gemaak. Dis per lem. Maak nie saak die grootte nie. Dit doen nie maak saak die grootte tot groot. Presies. En selfs 'n sk\u00ear, dis 'n kombuissk\u00ear. Sk\u00ear gaan in hul jag lekker visvang sk\u00ear ook. Ouens Ek is 'n bietjie verward. Iets is pla my, . Jy, Michael, is duidelik 'n suksesvolle Entrepreneur jy het natuurlik 'n redelike bietjie gemaak van geld. Hoekom soek jy hier? geld as jy 'n soort mooi het groot stapel vol al? Ek het voorheen misluk op die VSA Mark. Ons het nog 'n handelsmerk aan die gang gehad in die Amerikaanse mark sonder met Amerikaanse mense betrokke by die besigheid, met die fondse insameling en hoe jy dryf eintlik die groei van die Amerikaanse mark. Ek gaan nie doen nie weer daardie fout. Ons het twee uitgesit Strategie\u00eb. \u00d3f ons gaan waag kapitaal en kry waagkapitaal befondsde transaksie daarop of ons gaan alles Amerikaans oor wat ons gesien het as die volledig op Amerikaanse wys hoe jy bereik uit en die krag van die tenk. Watter deel van hierdie mark het u nodig? om te verstaan? Daar is boodskappe amper, dit is regtig die verpakking van die produk, hoe om dit te kommunikeer, dis kanaalstrategie. Presies wat is jou verkope? ons is op 120 aan hierdie kant van die jaar 120, 000. Hoe het u die verkope gekry? regtig, ek bedoel, Wat ons gedoen het, is hoofsaaklik Eksperimentering. Ons is nou op die 4de herhaling van ons webwerf. dit is soort van 'n bewys van konsep verkope wat ons tans doen. Ons gebruik, ons gebruik Facebook, Instagram, Google. Hoeveel het jy laas gedoen Maand? 37,037 duisend. Alles reg Luister Ek gaan jou 'n aanbod gee. Ek soos die konsep. Jy is vars, jy is uniek, jy is anders. Jy het reeds die verpakking af. Dit is regtig redelik goed. Ek dink jy is slim en moet weet wat die mark hier is. Daar is niemand wat van beter weet nie ek voel as wat ek dink ek ken iemand wie weet van beter. Nee daar is niemand wat weet nie Beter. Maar ek gaan. Dit is 'n riskante aanbod, OUKEI? Ek bedoel Ek het geen idee hoe dit gaan nie Gaan. Ek gaan jou net 'n pamflet. Jy kan dit neem of verlaat. Ek gaan vir jou 200 gee. Ek gaan jou 200 as 'n lyn gee van krediet en ek wil 20% h\u00ea. Ek bedoel As jy wil h\u00ea iemand moet jou net gee kontant, wonderlik, maar as jy wil h\u00ea iemand moet vir jou gee hulle verstand, hulle hart, hulle siel en die maal dit uit, Dis ek. Wel voor ons ja, kanaal strategie, kom ons bevolk dit net beter. 'N bietjie daaroor. Jy weet Ek dink dat digitale strategie, Dit is duidelik dat ons weet wat ons doen en hoe om te bekom. Ek glo regtig dat daar baie te doen het met fisiese kleinhandel. Wat bedoel jy fisiese kleinhandel? Ons kon dit uitsit. Hierdie Kleinhandelaars U wil h\u00ea dat hulle die diens moet verkoop en jy deel dit net. en William Sonoma, hulle het 'n bordjie opgesit en hulle s\u00ea het jou mes geslyp deur meshulpmiddels. Jy betaal Williams Sonova, jy weet, 25% daarvan en jy probeer om alles te kry kleinhandelaar nie net bereid om en dit is handelsmerkbou omdat hulle moet ons hul e-pos gee en dan betaal ons dit ook teen geld. Justin dis net 'n sekonde. Ek kan net wees soos om 'n kontak te kies, enige kontak. Ek het dit in elke enkele een van ons weet dit. Dit is hoekom ons hier is. En jy vra ons hoekom Ons is hier. Daarom is ons hier om jou 'n aanbod te maak. OUKEI Ek het dieselfde kontakte, maar ek het iets wat sy nie het nie h\u00ea. Ek is Chef Wonderful. Sjef Wonderlik is groot in koeke, sjokolade en vleis. Google hom. Hy is fantasties en ek hou daarvan om te merk goed in die kombuis. Ek sal kry agter hierdie produk 'want ek hou daarvan Baie. Hier is my aanbod, ek sal jou 400 gee, 000 vir 20%. Ek dink dit is 'n wonderlike idee omdat jy Chef Wonderful kry Ouens twee is altyd beter as een. wanneer jy die koningin van kleinhandel kry en dan sit jy dit saam, die koning van branding, Ek bedoel dit is nogal die paring. Ons wil ook graag vir jou 400 gee, maar 20% van die maatskappy, jy kry 2 haaie in plaas van 1. Self aangestel Sjef wonderlik. My handelsmerke kom in meer Amerikaners se hande as enigiemand anders in die paneel. Wag. Ek dink jy is baie aggressief in wat jy vra, maar ek hou van gulsige mense, ek en Kevin, Ons bied u $ 500,000 aan. Vir 20%. Ons is besig om die voorsprong te verhoog. As hulle wil Meeding Gaan voort. Maar ons is die regte span Vir jou. Daar is geen twyfel oor Dit. Jy weet Hier is die ding. Soms kan jy neem meer geld, maar dit beteken nie dat jy kry wat jy regtig nodig het. Dit maak sin. Wonderlike. Dit is wat jy nodig het. As ek kon vervul dit vir jou. Ons wil vinnig ry. Ons het die motor, Ons weet hoe om dit te skaal. Ons weet wat ons doen. En ons het nodig iemand s\u00ea neem daardie roete, dis vinniger. Neem daardie roete, dis vinniger. Wat ek doen, wat ons dit gedoen het, kom ons s\u00ea. Ja Ons wil almal 'n paar bou. Julle ouens wil dit 'n DTC-onderneming maak. Dit is 'n ekwiteitsmodel. Jy gaan meer kontant moet insamel. Om ons aan boord te kry, beteken dat die grootste waagkapitalistiese vallei goddelose waardasie gaan betaal. Soek oor by Markus. ek het 'n vraag. Wag jy vir Markus om vir jou te gee 'n aanbod? Nee Ek voel net baie energie kom van daardie kant van die kamer af. Maar soos, Ek weet nie wat aangaan nie. Jy gevra oor accelerant. Wat doen jy beskou as die accelerant wat Jy benodig? Ons wil net sterker uitreik h\u00ea. Ons het beter boodskappe nodig, nog duideliker boodskappe. daar is verskillende maniere om dit te doen, nie waar nie? Jy kan dit koop en dit is jou SEO, Regs? En dan is daar PR. Presies. En Dis reg. Daarom vra ek die vraag omdat sosiale, sosiale PRI beteken al die gratis verkeersbronne, di\u00e9 wat ons regtig wil doen. Ek dink ek is sterker as die ander want ek kan by enige media instap uitlaat en tel dit op, hanteer aanlyn wie ek wil. Maar Ek sal julle 'n besluit laat neem hier om te sien of hierdie transaksies is wat jy wil of nie en ek sal net wag. Wie sou s\u00ea? Ek voel regtig passievol oor want dit is al waarin ek gespring het Eerste. Het iemand anders spandeer 4000 dollar? Dis eg. Ek weet hoe om te skaal Omdat jy baie besighede het jy is by baie betrokke. Ons het dus nodig om te weet dat die persoon wat stap Aan boord saam met ons gaan eintlik om ons een uur meer te gee as die ander splinternuwe goed en dis Belangrik. $ 4000 op 'n lem, dis nie jou teikenmark nie. Ons is gaan hier 'n punt maak, Michael. Ons gaan jou 'n Oproep. Gesels net vinnig. Ja Ons het 30 sekondes. Dankie. Tim, julle is genoeg. Hoekom maak jy nie 'n aanbod nie? Ek is nie daarbo om te doen wat dit ook al is nie Neem. My. Hulle vat te lank. Jy moet kry hulle terug. Verskoon my? Ek het gedink dit is teen die re\u00ebls. Nee, daar is geen re\u00ebls nie, weet jy? Verskoon my Ouens. Jy wil weet van passie, Regs? Goed Ek sit nie en wag nie. Ek wil dit h\u00ea Deal. Ek is hier. Ek is by jou. OUKEI vir ons, ons wil jou regtig vra om beweeg tot 500 vir 20% omdat dit sal beter voel vir ons uitstap van hier met die wete dat ons dieselfde soos ander ouens. Hoekom nie? Ek kan nie eens hoor wat aangaan nie Nou. En regtig, doen elke filmvervaardiging, Ek dink ten minste, Gaan weg. Nee. Wat het ons nodig? Wat het ons nodig? Lori, Ek sal jou ondersteun. Ek is mal oor jou deal. En Ek dink ek en Barbara, julle weet wat? Boonop is ons alles ongeveer $ 100, 000. Ons het hierheen gekom met die teiken van Laurie en Ronan, maar ek wil h\u00ea hulle moet tot 500 styg. Wat het my gestuur en Markus sal uitstap Hier. Maar wag, Ek neem 'n uitdeelstuk. Wag. Kom ons gaan Kom ons gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons Gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons sluit. Kom ons Maak dit toe. Kom ons maak dit toe. Nee dis naby. Ek's jammer. Ek kon het vir jou 'n ekstra 100 000 gekry. Met vier haaie wat agter ons aanhardloop in die gange is iets wat ek sou nooit droom nie en ek was soos, Ek weet nie wat aangaan nie. Die sleutel was dat hy die 100 wou h\u00ea en as sodra ek klaar ges\u00ea het, dit was asof daar geen debat was nie.

quickly realize it doesn't matter if you lock your doors or not the traditional deadbolt isn't getting the job done let me show you this is your standard deadbolt while it may feel secure when you lock it an experienced Intruder can get in in about five kicks Alex show them how easy this is come on Alex kick it hard come on Alex Alex come on Al kick it how much you sell the Deadlocks [Music] for look we don't need to buy this product [Laughter] hey there go get mad and a Breakin occurs every 18 seconds the door knobs about to fall yeah that's persistence are you this isn't going are you typically a Breakin can happen in less than 2 minutes in the United States one in 36 homes in America will have a Breakin smart locks based at the deadbolt are no better Alex sure we're going to show you how works as you can tell I'm not an experienced Intruder I'm good let's show them how Haven Works clay yeah Haven sits at the bottom of the floor next to the existing threshold when activated the wedge based barrier lifts up using simple physics this makes your entire door 10 times stronger to preventing home break-ins to use it you simply step on the gate to open the door to shut the door you lock it with the gate with the foot pedal and you can see there's no dead bolt here Alex here K show them how it goes do the fly kick [Music] Alex all sharks no finally got it that's baby we don't give up all that's we don't give service absolutely God Haven is still standing strong we've got some demos we'll show you Alex you've gone down in Shark Tank history you will be memorialized for connected version Mark you hell yeah here you go cool all I'm going to grab a quick drink of water clay once don't you start sharks we've got two products that we manufacture we have a Haven mechanical Mech that you have on this side we have an electronic controlled one and Mark's got it down here on this side it's got a key fob you have with your car it also has a smartphone app where you can share e keys I would be able to send you access to my house schedule that I would get notification when you come and go what is each cost our cost for the mechanical only one we sell it on our website for $182 it cost us $67 to make it our landed cost is $82 our profit margin on that is 55% what about the Bluetooth version how much the connect version we sell for $3.49 on our website now cost of good sold is $175 wow that's a lot think we can get that down it's our our first batch of production at that cost do you have a patent issued on this year yes sir we got issuance from the UK we're still pending in in the US there's nothing this that's on the floor floor and that stop somebody enter cover the entire door and for sliding doors could you do it at the top yes ma'am that's the other exciting thing we want to tell you about is due to recent current events schools started approaching us to put this in individual classrooms huge Market there's over 115,000 schools in this country this is to protect the classroom from anybody getting in our plan is to lock down a classroom within 1 second and give teachers access and give security resource officer SWAT team access to the it's a good idea that's a great idea I don't think you told us what our your sales were far we crossed the $250,000 Mark of of total sales where are you selling them we sell online on our on our own website how much money have you raised and how much debt do you have we've raised 1.5 million that's a lot wow and how much debt do you have if any we have two investors with a convertible note debt of a total of $500,000 there we go are you two the sole owners 25% each and then we have investors on top of that with additional Equity to sell the school situation what is it that you have underway with schools tell them about the purchase order we got in Arkansas in in Melbourne Arkansas we installed three locks about a month ago they had an open house the parents loved it the next day I got a call from the superintendent and said I've got 94 classrooms left to do in this school I want to put in an order that's a big order they order they order 94 yes ma'am what are you going to do with the money sure our biggest problem is inventory simply we're going to use part of your investment to go out and scale inventory with our suppliers guys look I think what you've done is brilliant Mark let's let's do a deal but the challenge is the your economics are awful your margins are awful to support what you what you need to we're starting our manufacturing we have made 2,000 locks and got those into the customers we paid way over for those first 2,000 we're not going to pay that for the next 10,000 or the next 20,000 I think you're going to have a pretty hard time figuring out how to get the scale and figuring out what works and what doesn't I don't want to be part of the journey I'm sorry I'm out thank you for I think you have a huge mountain to climb and something that I don't think we'd get our money back for me I'm out thank you Barbara thank you much appreciate your time pitch yeah guys I think it's going to be difficult particularly from a cash flow perspective it's going to take you raising your price to generate the margins until your costs come down and even then the margins aren't there guys how about sure I think this is smart the problem for me is I to understand a product when I invest in it and you might be too early I can't invest at this point I'm sorry I'm out thank you much for your time what come on Dam let's do a deal I'm interested in it but sometimes it's it's what's in the best interest for the entrepreneur too I can give you a shark deal then you may have to raise more capital and then you get diluted or give them some to start with what do you want let them decide the only reason we're here is to get one of you on this team to guide us to Mentor us to get us into distribution opportunities and help scale our cost down we want you on this team you're not going to what I'm going to say because me taking more of the company then you own is not in your best interest and I need you to be a little selfish for yourself I'm not going to give you an offer I'm out thank you Damon thank you sharks good luck guys congratulations I am definitely a customer though this isn't our first objection and it's not going to be our last but there's a problem out there worth solving and we're going to keep going after it we're going to continue on the the team follows the motto that I lived in the Army we're never going to quit we have paying customers out there not only residentially but commercially and we're going to keep going\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 6%, 55%, 25% (PERCENT), every 18 seconds, less than 2 minutes,

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next into the tank is a stylish upgrade to an everyday appliance. [Music] Hi Sharks. I'm Elise. And I'm Sam. And we're seeking $600,000 for 3% of our company, Rocco. , Sam, before we get started, I'm a little thirsty. Why don't you go grab a drink from my kitchen fridge over there? One second, Sharks. I'm sorry. There should be a soda in there. You might have to dig dig a little bit. . , I hate it when that happens. I can't find anything in here. There's leftovers. There's produce. Where's the drinks? I think it should be behind the lasagna or or the pizza box, maybe. That's embarrassing. Sharks, as you can see, kitchen fridges are crowded. They're cluttered. They're plain chaotic. That's why we created the Roco Super Smart Drinks fridge. It's designed as furniture you can keep all of your favorite drinks away from those leftovers. And where you drink them, in the living room. You might be thinking, This is another wine fridge. Sorry, Mr. Wonderful, but nobody drinks wine anymore. We created a one-of-a-kind shelving system that accommodates all sizes of bottles and cans. Everything from ginger shots to champagne. The top doubles as a pour serve store station, aka it's also a bar cart. And with our patent pending site system, you can even see inside your fridge from your phone. Imagine you're at the grocery store. You're having friends over later and you can't remember if you have enough beer. Now, all you have to do is look at the app and you'll know exactly how much you need. , Sharks, who's ready to do a deal and pop some champagne? All . I know what's coming. All . what's coming. what's coming. [Applause] And in front of you are the trays that come with the fridge to turn it into a bar cart. How much is the fridge? The fridge is $14.95 and we currently offer early access pricing of $12.95. Is that a lot for a basic? As a matter of fact, I bought two not of yours. I didn't know about yours, but of a different one. And I will tell you, yours is the price and what the guy was trying to sell me was three times as much. How does the app work? Do I see into the fridge? , every time you put something in or take it out, it automatically images it. No scanning whatsoever. And your app will update. , I see shelf. Shelf by shelf. That's an innovation I haven't seen. Now, tell us about the two of you. Yes. , Sam and I have a combined 20 years of experience in startups. I cold emailed Casper, the mattress company, and I helped build the brand from the ground up. Then I went to Billy, the women's razor brand, which sold a few years ago to one of the biggest CPG companies. Sam spent many years at Away leading supply chain and product development. And while he was at Away, the suitcase brand, his work took him to fridge factories because, believe it or not, there are manufacturing similarities between fridges and suitcases. You sell it for $12.95 or $14.95. What does it cost you to make? , our landed costs are $575 and then after shipping, which is another $130 to $160 depending on where you are in the country, it gets to around 750 to 775. , you don't have much margin. No. How do you how do you sell it today? Director, how many have you sold? over 3,000. Sam, have you guys raised a lot of money? We raised a million dollars about a about 2 years ago. At what valuation? That was at $10 million on a post money save. Why are you telling us you're worth 20 now? that was 2 years ago before we even had a prototype. We've been in market for 8 months. We've done $4 million of revenue. We're profitable in 8 months. In 8 months that ready that's shipped and we've ordered enough units to be able to do a $12 million year this year, which is what we're forecast. And on that $4 million, how much have you spent to create the buzz? we have a return on ad spend of five times. , we spend about $250 per fridge or 20% of our revenue. Look, I it. I the story. I the pitch. I the whole direct. You guys are great. I I I don't the valuation. , here's what I'll do. I'll give you the 600,000 for 10%. , they're going to jump at that. I think they should. I think they I think they should. Wow, that was a loud laugh. That's why I laugh all the time. Look, I don't think you're worth more than six million bucks. I'm sorry, guys. I think it's a beautiful product. I'm not sure I see the vision. I don't see it. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate guys. Here here's where I'm at. Look, great product, great company. Problem is a math problem. When you price it at a $20 million valuation in order for me to get my $600,000 back, you have to do $20 million in net cash flow profits. $20 million cash flow profits. 3% of that is my $600,000 back. If I want to get a multiple return since it's a risky environment, let's say three or four times, you need to do 60 $80 million in free cash flow to give me a return. That's the challenge of making this investment. , for those reasons, I'm out. Yeah. And I'm in a similar place. It's hard to imagine that things could pan out in a way that would be good for you and for us. I also was thinking about how I could add value to you and I probably could find a few ways, but I don't know that I would be the best shark for you for this deal. , for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Lori. , listen, I love you both. The real problem for me is your valuation. , it's rough. Mark said it all. I'm not even going to try to repeat it cuz he said it all squarely. What would you consider to be reasonable? Yeah, we're open. , you guys would not want to even know. Kevin was at 10. I I'm going to be honest. to me, you're startup. I would have been at 20, which you're never going to consider. It doesn't feel the deal. , I'm sorry. I'm out. All roads lead to Mr. Wonder. , I I I think you heard it from everybody in the same succinct way. Valuation is a huge problem. . I think your offer is generous. I do. I gave him a 6 million valuation with no path to liquidity. , there's a lot of risk in it. I happen to think my social would blow this up huge if you were able to figure out a way to fulfill and I also think I can reduce your CAC. Do you mind if we talk about your offer for a second and speak amongst yourselves? Thank you. Sorry. Do you want to bring I want to bring someone else back in. Sorry. Yeah. Lot of whispering going on. No, I've been thinking about your free cash flow comment, but this is a category where the free cash flows of say Whirlpool, it's a billion dollars. Her who bought out GE, it's $2 billion. How many products do they have? They have five. How long did it take him to get there? 100 years. What's happening here? Kevin has an offer on the table, which doesn't always stay there. , I have to be honest with you guys. I'm out. All five sharks are out. Sam and Elise had an offer on the table from Kevin for their designer beverage fridge, Rocco, but their hesitation led to a change of heart. The only offer you had was me. And then you're talking to Cuban again. , Mr. Wonderful doesn't feel good about that. You hurt his feelings. I now will forget who you are tomorrow morning because there's going to be five more deals coming through that door. I'm out. See you guys later. Ciao. We wanted to offer a royalty. I'm not sure if there's a way to get you back in. What's your offer? What is it? We want to We can be a little flexible on the valuation. , let's let's do a royalty particularly tied to your channels. No, I'm not doing that. The minute my name is on this, it's every unit gets a royalty because all of a sudden it's a Mr. Wonderful deal. If you don't believe that, talk to my 54 CEOs. See what they say. What's the royalty you would give? Yeah, but only on what Kevin generates. I'm not doing that. I'm not either. Yeah. I'm not making up a commission saleserson. I'm an investor with a huge curious what's the royalty you would give. What would you give? You do the marketing numbers. I'm not doing that deal. I I'm not for I'm the one asking. Where's the fridge? It was 50. $50 a fridge. Until you get your money back. I want to throw something back at you. . No qualifiers, but $600,000. $50 a fridge. That's it. If we can keep the regular equity ask, we'll do $50 every fridge back. $50 every fridge. Would you do it till five at 5%? 4%. 5%. 4% 5%. Can we talk about that for one sec? I do it at 3% in perpetuity, which is forever. Take the deal. , you're going to We plan to be around for a long time. , a long time. As long as we're all full. 4% and until you get your money back. We'll meet you in the middle. How about 4% until I get my money back plus another 300,000? Done. Done. There you go. Wonderful. Boom. Oo. Who knew? Now I bought that other fridge. my. , we're going to have to replace them. , good deal. Good idea. Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Thank you.

and when it comes to Quick Serve restaurants there's only two options available one something that's affordable made from questionable meat-based product or two something that a wing and a leg that's on the healthier side and As Americans we all deserve affordable access to plant-based foods and that's why we created project poo real delicious food made from real plants now our original project is a hand braded crispy chicken patty that's made from 100% soy and it's truly to die for but no animals had to die for it to be this good now we didn't stop there we also have burgers wraps salads shakes and yeah my personal favorite Buffalo mac and cheese and take a look at that and sharks our mission was simple we wanted everyone regardless of their income to be able to afford these options after all the future of mass consumption is plant-based now sharks it's time that we demand better it's time that we free the chickens it's time that we start putting people over the profits and start doing poo with a purpose and that's why I'm here today embrace your yourself sharks seeking $2.5 million in exchange for 5% of my company hello now sharks you all choke on that valuation million valuation 50 million milon I the opportunity for all to try the product I've made for you guys today in front of you the half sandwich is going to be our Deluxe chicken sandwich you have our chicken nuggets on there served alongside of our fries and then of course the Buffalo mac and cheese sitting there happy to answer questions for you guys but please enjoy good I appreciate that thank you coming from a true Chef that's amazing yeah Chef wonderful likes it I've tried a lot of fake chicken this is the best I've had appreciate that it's proprietary for us and that's one of the reasons we are taking this initiative to scale out as quickly as we are lcas do your customers Get Fooled by the name I would assume pulling up to your place at project Polo meant it was chicken yeah and we did that strategically because we wanted to engage with the guest and we explain at the counter this is 100% plant-based we have a people that are reluctant that want to step back and say no it's not for me that's our interaction with them to say let us give you a sample let us buy your first meal it's on us if you don't it no problem Lucas look the food's great I got it 50 million valuation Lucas Honey Sweetie Poopsy let's get to it you must have a ton of sales yeah I thought that there was a void in the market for someone to take some initiative and go on an National level positioning themselves to put plant-based Foods out there is there a number coming soon there is let me let me tell you this little backstory here and gets swoll the later it comes typical story max out credit cards take every bit of savings out of the family's account my wife never knew about it dumped it all bought a food truck response was great that was September 18th last year and then open another location December January are these trucks or locations these are all physical brick and mortar locations now corporate own you corporate own we have our 11th and 12th locations opening next week now if we stopped current progress with these opening stores we'd be doing roughly shy of 10 million let's talk about what you've done year to date year to date we're shy of 3 million that's that's going through the end of August we're shy forward looking we should be hitting six maybe that 3 million is how many stores that's off of eight stores wait they opened up all these stores in one year I've never heard of such a thing how how do you do that fast yeah I don't want to drag this on for the next 5 years wondering if my concept has validity if it has scalability originally made the decision we're going as fast as we possibly can you didn't have proof of concept you needed a lot of money you needed a lot of Manpower and you it's taking an enormous risk all at once 100% where did you get all the other money obviously let me walk you through the money bootstrapped out of my pocket to start off with how much money did you put into it that was the food truck that was the food truck our first location in Austin all I put about roughly ballpark about 60,000 up front obviously not paying myself for anything and then maxing out cards different things of the sort to get us to that Austin location got it open obviously Austin Texas is a receptive market for plant-base exceptionally off the bat what were your sales at first in Austin we were doing only about $10,000 a week over about a 90-day period that got up to about $23,000 a week and it became a good store for us because that store is about 27 % profit margin as we continue to scale going into next year I have out 18 additional locations we're going to be opening but we have the foundation to do 24 it seems to me I'm sorry to be doubtful sure and I'm an optimist yeah but it seems way way too spectacular for me I'm confused as to how as to how fast figuring out where these locations would be getting some type of real estate deal on boarding a team and then for your locations in other cities what and building it out even total chaos which comes with to chaos I thrive in chaos I'm an operator I'm curious what is your debt to have done all of that fast how much Mone have Z in debt zero debt yeah I raised 1.75 million back in June at of 17.5 million valuation off a single investor that Capital can take us up through the end of next year back to your question when you ask how is it done Co obviously was devastating for a lot of people you had a lot of Nationals that liquidated I thought of it as an opportunity to go in and get those leases you were getting a great rate we were gotting great rates I signed 10year deals wow of course you did yeah what's your background you are with all of this I grew up super low-income family my dad was a bus driver and my mom she was a cook at our elementary I got made fun of my whole life for my mom being our elementary cook and I wanted nothing to do with the restaurant business a college came around needed money became a delivery driver at a a Pizza Hut and my personality and my drive I moved up quick and through all the positions supervisor managers Etc I caught myself in a Great Divide because I wanted to continue in the qsr space but I recently turned vegetarian at that time and I had an opportunity to go work for a regional company out San Antonio that was plant-based and they were wanting to scale quickly in our scale we went from one location increased sales by 72% Within 6 months open up three additional locations that this enormously lightning speed it's not new to you you've been doing this it's not new but it's the interesting part I said earlier I want to find out real quick validity and scalability Lucas let me take a stab at it I'm a pragmatic investor Financial balance sheet guy I'm impressed with your executional skills I believe you this this rush to open units is impressive but you're asking me to pay you a valuation as if you've already achieved a 10 million run rate I'm choking on it not the chicken I'm choking on the valuation I'm having a real hard time with it I got to give you $25 million which is a serious chunk of change I get nothing I get a tip in equity and as you finance if it's not going to be debt Equity I get diluted further down I feel I'm getting deep fried it's it's it's brutal I I can't go there I'm out I'm out appreciate that feedback let let me jump in as what you've accomplished is great but I've got two problems one plant-based does not mean healthy sure there's nothing healthy about what you're doing and to me that's going to fall off Trend quickly I think over the next 2 to 3 years it's going to go the opposite direction where plant-based and healthy have to go together that's a challenge in my mind that plus the valuation I'm out I I respect that and I understand the healthy aspect of that our concept is a build built around accessibility and affordability for the average American how much does it cost think we know what a chicken sandwich costs our average menu item is 650 I'm going to say man it's fast it you I I got the truck after I got the truck we did this I I thrive in chaos and that's how I succeed and now we're here we're here we're here I think it's too much of a risk especially for what your ask is for me for that reason I'm out is there a number that makes more sense to you that may not be such a high valuation that you're more comfortable making that investment in listen I'm here to make a deal with a partner I'm not here for commercial I'm not here for the prime time I'm here looking clear the field here you remind me of the business called Tom and Chi probably seven years ago they came into Shark Tank great guys great operation they had two stores when they came in here a truck in a store in St Louis within 2 years they had 35 within four years they lost everything they're bankrupt they not only lost their business they lost both houses sad thing I'm not suggesting that for you but they were too darn fast too darn fast fast and all my buttons are going up the idea that you're building a business that could be worth a lot and the idea that you're moving fast it's the farthest thing that I could ever feel comfortable with and even go to bed at night and sleep I wouldn't be able to do it for those reasons about I appreciate that I do and I I think on the one hand I can see I understand where your mind is going it's look what I did I was smart I was Scrappy I went into real estate where no one else had it I got 10e locked in great rates but you're a tornado you don't know what's going to happen when that touches down cuz you want to keep going Cyclone still going and that's scary to me and your valuation astronomically High am out I get that it's high and again I'm looking for a partnership here 2.5 million too much me a deal yeah it's too much if you come in here for 500,000 might have worked but not this I'm sorry Lucas thank you for\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Poyo America's (LOC), first, 11th

It's been 400,000 in 3 4 months. Correct. . Only at that one chain, Urban Outfitters, now cuz we gave them exclusivity. And that's why we're here that I can exclusivity. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

That's how you protect your Heiney when poop happens. Kevin, you're wrong. You were Let me finish my thought. I'm going to help you a lot. You're all in to one channel. That's your big bet. You've got a big bet with Urban Outfitters. It's too risky. I'm out. Incredibly impressive sales in a , short amount of time. What's the bigger plan? Are you going to sell online? Are you going to go to other retailers? The bigger plan is to build out our direct to consumer. We want to build out that app where it's that video shopping app making it extremely simple for people to to watch and shop all in one place. You're asking for $500,000 on a baby baby business. It's way too much money for me to have confidence to give you that dough. It doesn't make any sense. There's no room for a partner in this deal now. , I'm out. , we're on track for 1.2 this year. Listen, I have a big dream to make this happen. And I know that if we build out this online channel, this direct to consumer, and because these customers are, , attached to me, we can make this happen. You have a major retailer, cool, popular retailer, and you're in and they've already given you big purchase orders and you've already proven your success. I think you should try to keep making things and funneling it to them. Have them keep expanding you. I don't see this as an investment for me now because my I have a completely different thought on on the way that you should go. , I'm out, but I'd be a customer. You're cool. Great way to start a business, but you have to change your entire strategy. And that's what you need the money for. For 500,000, I want a little more proof. I wish there was more data. To me, you're a pure startup looking for half a million dollars. I can't see it. I'm out. Hillary, there's good news for you, Hillary. You're here on a unique day in Shark Tank history. There are six sharks. You still have 33 and a3% chance. Two sharks are still looking at you to get a deal. And those two are down there. I was inspired by a company called Cross Colors that came out. They went to $100 million, but they were mainly in one chain called Merrygoround. And when Merrygoround went bankrupt in one year, they were gone. But I have an offer for you. I what you're doing. , I'll give you the $500,000 and I will I'll ask for 33 and a3%. . All . , that's an offer. Thank you. , I've had experience here with the Red Dress Boutique, ? And they came in doing the same thing, selling on social media. don't buy it until it's already sold and their biggest challenge was online. We had some challenges because they were growing quickly, but we've gotten through them and now they'll do $14 million plus this year. But here's my offer. . I don't want to team with anybody, ?

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] First in the tank is a winter sport accessory that is functional and fashionable. [Music] Hi Sharks. My name is Kelly and I'm Christina. We're from San Francisco, California and today we're seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10% equity of our company Yard Sale. Sharks, if you've ever skied, you probably agree with us. Ski poles suck. They're clunky and easy to drop. Plus, they're made of cheap materials. They come in limited colors. And I think we can all agree they're pretty ugly. We're lifelong skiers and know firsthand that people are constantly looking to upgrade their ski gear. But when it comes to innovation, ski poles have been , long forgotten. That's why we started Yard Sale. Yardell ski poles blend clever design and great style for the everyday skier. The best part about yard sale poles, they're magnetic. We've hidden magnets in the handles in the basket that they stick together, making walking to and from the car or getting on and off the lift an even easier experience. Skiers love how yard sale poles are fully modular you can mix and match between the five eye-catching colors on our website to create your own custom pair. With Yardell, we're not only making ski days easier and more fun, but we're creating a lifestyle brand for the millions of recreational skiers out there. , Sharks, who's ready to ditch your old poles in the snow and ride the chairlifts with Yard Sale? , I love it. I got to ask name. Yes. Why the name yard sale? . Haven't you ever had a yard sale on the mountain? , yeah. Kendra, are you what? Are you a black diamond skier? You don't know what a yard sale is? It's when you lose everything. Your skis come off, your poles come off. It's they call it , , a yard sale, a garage sale. , does everybody that skis know that? Because it's an it's an insider term. Kendra clearly is a skier in the room and clearly I've had a lot of yard sales and it goes a bit back to the origin stories of how we came up with the idea. Christina had a infamous epic yard sale or wipeout and that's where she came up with the idea. I had a bad yard sale. It got me thinking about my greatest frustration with the product, which for me is when you're carrying them, they're always crossing over, they're falling down. And I thought, why has nobody put magnets on ski poles? And are you the only one doing this? Yes, we are. I started tinkering with my old poles and I taped some magnets to the handles of these. I walked around the corner to Kelly's house cuz he lives close by to me and I asked him what he thought. No one has ever in decades rethought the humble ski pole. Yet every skier needs them to ski. What are your backgrounds? I've always been passionate about design and I was fortunate to follow that pursuit to MIT where I studied mechanical engineering and product design. afterwards I worked at Apple as a product designer across various teams and as an avid skier I was ready to jump into a consumer product. are you guys full-time in this? We are. We are. Yeah. my background is more on the marketing side of things. After college I worked for a hardware tech startup in marketing and then I transitioned to the venture capital side where I was the head of content and PR for a VC firm in San Francisco. One of the most important things to note as is that over 60% of our customers online customize their polls which means that we have a huge adoption. You're not doing any retail, ? , we are in a few specialty stores. , what's your price compared to a regular pull off? Absolutely. , we launched 6 months ago. , and we make the product for about $30. We landed it for 42 and we sell it for$1 139. It's 75% margin. What are the average poles? Great question. We're in the upper middle range in the market. , on the lower end, you have about $50, $60 poles, which are cheap aluminum ones, but on the upper end, you have advanced poles, but we sit in the middle. And there's other pools that are, , in our range, but no one that offers features we do. What have you sold far? Yeah, great question. Yep. In the first month, before the holidays this past year, we did $100,000 in sales in our first month. , we are fiscal year to date, , $220,000 in sales. 220. Yes. And we are forecasting to end the year, which for us ends in September, at $300,000. Next year, we're forecasting $2.1 million. Where and how did you sell them? Yeah. , we we launched DTOC only. , we'll be expanding into retail next winter with with who? , what was exciting is in our first 30 days, we had REI reach out to us backountry decathlon in Europe. When I get new poles, I'm in the boots in the store and we're sizing and the, , we're trying to figure out exact, , the pose, ? , what happens to you? Those are a little do you need multiple different sizes of this inventory? They they come in five sizes. , but that's that's an inventory nightmare. , we've got an answer for you, Mr. Wonderful. What you can see in our kids poles, which are on the far left here, is that they're adjustable. And we'll have adjustable poles for adults next year as . , wait, you mean they'll continue to slide? Yeah. , , as kids grow, they'll grow with kids from ages 10 to 22. By the way, I don't see that out there. Let me tell you how I feel. , first of all, I don't love the name. I think it has a bit of a negative connotation and an incorrect connotation for a premium quality brand new item that's innovative. Yard sale feels it's a disaster and it's when the worst thing happens and then I'm not a skier and have to feel passionate about the product. Love the people but don't feel it here. , I'm sorry I'm out. Thank you much. I love the name. when I saw a fubu they were what is a fubu Italian? Is it Japanese? Is it number three that on the poo poo platter? What is it? And that exactly became a conversation that stood out from everybody. how many times people come up here, their name is too close to something else and then they spend a lot of money and they lose it. They I will say it is one of the biggest reasons skiers have paid attention to our brand. I agree. I'm part of the the snowboarder community and we hate you guys. I don't know. I don't skiing. this is not for me. I wish you all the best. Great innovation. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you, Damon. I've never skied once in my entire life and I have no intention of starting. , for those reasons, I'm out. I love this. I love the name. This is great. It's catchy, but , you're early. This is 6 months in. You're putting a $2 million valuation on a business with what you're asking. And we realized there's a high risk behind that. And , , one of the things that we did was we we, , are obviously asking for $200,000 for 10%. , but we do have a lot of profit margin in our product. And therefore, we do have a bit of a secondary offer in our back pocket, which Mr. Wonder say, Mr. Wonderful, we'd love to talk to you about. , if you're willing, we'd love to make you an offer of $200,000 for 5% with a $3 royalty until you recoup your initial investment of $2,000. That's the first time a company has ever offered to Kevin a royalty. A royalty. , afraid of a royalty. That's the first. I would prefer to model it this way. , I'll do the 200,000 for 20% and I'll take my chances on distributions. I want a distribution when you distribute to yourselves, but I want I want to wet my beak on this one. I want 20%. Yeah. , yes, absolutely. We'd love to talk about what Kevin would have to do to roll up his sleeves and help us. , , I don't want a job. . , you said you need somebody who's going to roll your sleeves up. Honey, I've done it. I get retail. I get omni channel. I think you have a great direct to consumer, but wholesale is where you can build this business. That's how I started, Kendra Scott. I I'm going to do 20% as , plus I want the $3 back until I recoup my 200K. . Thank you. All . The difference here is I do think I can help you with this wholesale strategy. I'll drop my ass to 15%. But I'll take the $3 royalty till I get back 400,000. , it's a 2x. Would you be interested in doing $200,000 for 8%, we'll drop that equity down, but we'll increase your royalty to $5 a unit until you recoup $300,000. We'll do it at 10%. I want the royalty, but I want a 2x on it. . That's going to put us in a tight position in the future. , we think at five at $5 a unit, we can get you your 300K back if you we'll take that offer within under two years. Getting my money back is not not why I do deals. I want to get a multiple audit. Kendra, would you be interested in that a royalty offer, which is $200,000 for 8% with a $5 unit royalty until you recoup $300,000 back? what? I that. I that. I do it. Can we do 10% and you have yourself a deal? If you'll drop to 250 on the royalty payback, you got yourself a deal. 300. my god. $50,000 cash. Come on. Pay off the upfront cash to $250,000 at 10% with a $5 royalty until you recoup $300,000 back. Done. Done. Let's go. I'm going to come over here. I'm skiing over. Thank you much. Thank you, Kendra. Thank you much. much fun. I'm going to have these everywhere I go. Thank you much. excited. Thank you all. You skis deserve each other.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First, first (ORDINAL), San Francisco, California, VC (GPE), poles, Italian, Japanese (NORP), Europe (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** yard sale, ski poles, a yard sale, a lot, the product, the name, a royalty, san francisco\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 blend: design\n  \u2022 create: custom pair\n  \u2022 create: lifestyle brand\n  \u2022 love: it\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 call: it\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 rethink: ski pole\n  \u2022 follow: pursuit\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.14)\n\n**Topics:** sale, pole, yard, royalty, skier",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext into the tank is a solution for a stinky problem. [Music] Hi Sharks. My name is Christa Woods and if you stink, it's not my fault. My company is Glovesticks and I'm looking for $150,000 for a 10% stake in my business. As a mother of three athletic children, I wasted way too much time and money trying to get rid of the odor that was living in their sweaty gear. I tried every chemical spray, every wash, every trick, and nothing worked. That's when I invented glove sticks. They are an easy to use odor management solution that is solving the world's stink problem, one athlete at a time. My sticks are unique because they address the odor problem three ways. The plastic on the outside contains silver ions. They will quickly inhibit 99.9% of odor-causing bacteria growth in a 24-hour period. On the inside, you have these replaceable inserts. They absorb moisture and deodorize. They work in gloves, shoes, boots, cleats, helmets, knee pads, you name it. You put the sticks in and they get the stink out. , what do you say? A deal with me definitely will not stink. Are you going to show us your product? Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Krista. You're welcome. [Music] These double as dump trucks. Thank you much. Yes, exactly. Everybody says that. That's why the kids love them. My company has two products. What you're holding there, some of you are holding glove sticks and some some of you are holding shoe sticks. The glove sticks have a wrist guard clip that you can hang the gloves on a gear rack if you prefer. Chrisa, , I spent over 20 years in a major league locker room and boy, I wish I had these when I played for some of my teammates. Yes. Yeah. How does it work exactly? , the moisture gets trapped inside the gear and then it has nowhere to go. It breeds odorcausing bacteria. We're talking staff, EC coli, MRSA, mold, mildew. That's what's living in our kids gear. , let me ask you a question about that claim. I I have a lot of shoes. They're handmade by Italian virgins. They're beautiful, but or they say to you. When I when I bring them home, each set of shoes has a last form. In other words, they're made out of cedar. I insert them into the shoe to to hold them in place while I don't wear that set. And I go on to one of my other 20 pair. Yes, I'm a a market. the only guy on earth that has that. The reason they're cedar is true or false, cedar absorbs odor and has for hundreds of years. It's also kills bacteria. Is this better than cedar? It is better than cedar. Cedar does not kill bacteria. It simply absorbs moisture. There are no products that do both. That's why my products work and that's why we're growing at such a rapid pace. And I have a patent on it. You do? I got it four days ago. , how has that panned out? , you said your sales are skyrocketing. Give us the details. , my sales are $56,000 by a year and a half, but $440,000 in the last year. And where are you selling them? , I sell online. I have a website and I'm also on Amazon. And then I'm about 55% wholesale. It's me and the company. I have no employees. I also have been on QVC four times. I was going to say, I thought I recognized I stalked you in the cafeteria one day. You got through all the bodyguards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. 150,000 for 10% imputes a $ 1.5 million value on a on an odor stick. , what we haven't It's more than an odor stick, but what we haven't talked about is the re the reoccurring income. , we retail these for $29.99. They come in the package ready to go with the inserts in them. , what you're not realizing is you have to change the inserts. What does pack cost? To retail it for $7.95. , that's expensive. I'm never going to agree with you on your valuation. . Rather than beat you up on it, I'm going to step out. What you're doing is incredible. Thank you. Can you tell me a little bit about your background? I was 18 when I got pregnant. I had to drop out of high school. Ready or not, I was going to be a single mother. , I took on that challenge despite my fears. And I fought those fears every single day. And , when I was 22 years old, I was promoted to a manager in a maledominated industry. Good for you. And at 24 years old, I met the most awesome guy and married him. And we are still married today. We have two other children. And I'm not only doing it, I am nailing it. I am nailing it. Good for you. Thank you. For the last year and a half, people have asked me if I was going to go on Shark Tank. I said, No way. And then a few months ago, I realized it was my fear talking because I'm scared now, but I'm fighting it to be here in front of you all. I know that you all can take my product to the next level. I know I have something unique, original, and I know it's going to sell. You You struck every cord in my body. , I come from a single mother. , she had two jobs. I would see her leaving the house at 7:00 a.m. and come home at at midnight and sometimes I would wake up at night and count her tip money. , I want to say congratulations. Thank you much. Christa, I want to talk a little bit about how you're going to scale this business. Yes. It seems to me that you're a micromanager and you're connected, which is great, but all great entrepreneurs at some point you have to be able to delegate. Absolutely. That's why I'm here. , to be honest, I wouldn't be here if I wasn't looking for someone that has the expertise to take me to the next level. Krista, that Alex brings up a good point. Why haven't you hired somebody to help you? , I started hiring people to help with sales all over the country. I have a few people selling in other states. what I think? I think you're a perfectionist. I'm not a perfectionist. I want to do this . , I have my kids sitting at home watching me now and I want to do this . Crystal, look, what you've accomplished is amazing, ? You should be proud of yourself, but it's what you do next that matters. Yeah. I have a saying, perfection is the enemy of profitability, ? Perfection is also the enemy of growth where you try to hold on tight, ? I think you're going to have a hard time letting go. I'm out. , Kristoff, I have utmost respect for you and what you've done, but I'm a lot more interested in you than I am in the product. I personally am out. Thank you. I appreciate it. When I first started my business, I didn't take in a whole bunch of people. I had to wear a lot of hats and I had to play a lot of roles and I did it all myself. And I did it because I wanted to make sure everything was done . There's no one else but you who will feel the passion, have that dedication, and make sure things are perfect. And when I hear that, that only makes me you more. I would to make you an offer. The part about it that I I don't know as much about is the whole sports side with gloves and equipment and all of that, but I do think there's a shark sitting up here, Alex, who knows a lot about that can bring to real. You're inviting him in cuz he's good looking. Come on, don't for cuter in person. Thank you. Are you interested in this? ? , I think that you would be a good partner in us being able to hit both sides of the market, the glove sticks and the shoe sticks. Alex, I'd to partner with you 150,000 for 20%. If you're interested in going in with me, Three Sharks are out. Christa is asking for $150,000 for a 10% stake in her odor eliminating product, Glovesticks. Lorie is interested, but only if she can partner with Alex. Alex, I'd to partner with you. 150,000 for 20%. If you're interested in going in with me. Before I answer that, Laura, I I have a few concerns Chris that I'd to get into a little bit here. Here's the the problem with a lot of young entrepreneurs. As you scale a business, whether it's back office or administration or deploying capital, as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it gets a lot more challenging. I'm here today because of that reason. I want to be I'm open-minded. I'm here because I know that I've reached the max of my knowledge and how to get me further. what? I I you, Lori. I I will do the 20% as long as you're open-minded and let us help you and walk you through this process. That's why I'm here. You have an offer 150,000 from Lori and Alex for 20%. What are you gonna do? One of the things that I talked to my husband about was my equity. I know I have a huge business here. , I was hoping not to go over 15%. Is there any way the two of you would do the 150,000 for 15%. I have a patent. No one can copy me. Are you going to take that push back? What about you, Alex? what? If it's with Lori, if you split it, we have a deal. 17 and 12% 17 and 12% you have a deal. I would do that. All . All . Come here, Mom. You guys stink. I'm a ball player.

I'm from a small farm town of Salena, Ohio, and I'm seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10% of my company. Sharks, let me ask you a question. Have you ever been inspired by a good idea when doing maintenance on a fighter jet machine gun? All the time. Every day. , I have. I'm an F-16 weapons mechanic in the United States Air Force, and I encounter a problem time and time again. When working on top of the aircraft, I'm constantly trying to keep my tools close and my hardware organized. Seems a simple enough task, but on the aircraft's slick surface, it is nearly impossible. Would you believe me if I told you that in general aviation to solve this problem, mechanics are using anything from rags, muffin trays, and my favorite, urinal cakes. Yes, hopefully clean urinal cakes. Clearly, these products aren't cutting it. To solve this problem, I introduce to you the Grip Mat. It's a flexible, non-slip tool tray, ensuring that your tools and hardware stay in place on any surface. We currently have three sizes, the small, medium, large. All equipped with the ability to hold tools up to a 70\u00b0 angle. Let me show you how it works. The small equipped with six compartments to keep your hardware organized. The medium has two small compartments and an open field for hand tools. And then the large has four small compartments, an open field for hand tools, and then handles you can easily move your workstation. Although the grip mat was born into aviation, it can be found useful in every field. Whether it's making hats out of your garage, building rockets, assembling computers, making jewelry, or tinkering underneath the hood of your car. , Sharks, one question remains. Who here is ready to get a grip? A grip mat, that is. Do you have samples for us to look at? Yes. And thank you for your service. Thank you. Absolutely. Yeah. , this is the medium. The medium is the most popular size, ? , if you notice on the medium and the large, there's also a measurement system. What I love about Shark Tank is that everyday people are solving everyday problems with with Virgin Galactic in mind and with our airlines in mind. , yeah, this would be tremendous. Our engineering teams, they would welcome something this enormously. out whether we can make an offer now. If anyone that owns a airline, let me know and we could we could look I I tell you what, we would definitely buy them. the question is whether you can make money as a business. have you sold any yet? Do you have a business area? we've sold roughly 10,000 units, total of $400,000 in sales. And when did you start selling? We started selling roughly 10 months ago. What was your net? between $15 and $200,000 which I've taken that and reinvested into inventory. Wow. Good for you. Good for you. That's impressive. All . Where have you been selling them? Yeah. , the big thing has been selling online. Trade shows have been significant for us far. I've gotten a handful of fighter jets and then also I've sold to NASA. We're specifying in the aviation industry and we're about to grow into the automotive industry. Are you going to go into retail with with it at all? That's something honestly I need guidance on of how to navigate with especially with the big box. to my understanding they'll push you around. What's the application for cars though? I'm underneath the car. Everything's flat, ? If you're working underneath the hood of the car, typically what you're doing is you're scattering your tools all over the engine. , your tools are typically black or silver, which blend into the engine. , the key thing within the product is getting the user in the habit of putting the tools into the tray. , building that habit. . , what do you sell them for at retail? What's your cost? Yeah. , retail, the small is $29.99. The medium is $44.99. Wow. The large is $69.99. Landed cost is roughly 25% of that. Is this silicone? It's a silicone polymer mix. Silicone goes to 500\u00b0. Correct. Let's say on an engine or if it's hot, that's not going to melt. Silicon goes to 500\u00b0. You're smart, ladies. Smart. , aren't there other silicon trays out there? No. , the hot thing that's been selling is it's a sheet of material. the the big thing is having the lip of things can't roll down. Have you applied to any for any patents or anything? Yes, now we have a utility patent pending. how much have you invested far? personal money about $40,000 and then also raised about $150,000 through grants and doing business competitions. You are incredible my friend. Tom, what what's the next step? My vision for the company is to keep in inventing new products. , that's something that I see a lot that's a big problem within startup community is that they're not innovative people. It's people with an innovative idea. They have one good idea and they can't make 2.0. They can't shock the world with the next generation. , what is your 2.0? I want to have more products that integrate with the grip mat. Things that would attach to the grip mat, if it's a flashlight, a magnet, or if it's, , something with a lid. If you're going to be the chief innovation officer. Yes. . Who's going to run the company? that's where I'm slowly building a team. . your challenge appears to be back office putting together a salesforce, ? Having an organization already in place, ? you can focus on innovation while someone else handles all the nuts and bolts of the business. Yes. I'm curious about you. You said that you grew up in a small town in Ohio. Can you tell us about yourself? Growing up, I always wanted to be an inventor. Came time to go to college. My parents told me that they weren't going to pay for my college. , , to call their bluff, I told them I was going to join the military. , turns out they weren't bluffing. And , now I've been in the service for 8 years now. What are you going to do with the 200,000? , going to reinvest it into more inventory we can beef up our our volume we can get the price down per piece. All , Tom. Listen, I see a different application. I think there's something else here. I think this is good for infants. I think this is good for if you're living with dexterity issues in hospitals. Damon, you can't put your baby in Barbie shoes. , trust me, babies to throw things across the room, ? Or or even in hospital beds, ? , the the tray can easily slide off. , are there other areas that you've tried to sell at all? , I had a lot of interest in gunsmiths. U medical was a big one. I'm from Britain. What What's the gun? Yeah, I think this can have a lot of applications. I want to take it over to my friends over at Cox Automotive and also go into the areas I talked about. , I'm going to offer you 200,000 for 25%. . , we have a guest. But get him. Isn't that a great offer? I think I asked for 10, but we'll see. We'll see. What What's the market that you think you have to be in that's going to propel you? To me. To me, aviation. It's easy kills. I think aviation is overrated. I have a deal on a table. I have three planes, ? I have my own little airline that I own% as opposed to having investors. I'm sure Richard has his own planes. Excuse me, billionaires. I have 200,000 on the table for 25%. , all . Every time I've got to prove my love, I got 200,000 for 20%. 20%. We're getting closer. What? You went to 20? I went to 20 cuz I don't have time for you guys. , I'll be honest with you guys. My mission here is to get as many sharks to take a bite out of Grip Mat today as possible. Now, if you want multiple sharks, you realize you have to give up more equity cuz it's not worth 5% if we split it two ways. Correct. What would you offer for two or three sharks? [Music] , it depends on the sharks. All sharks are still in. Tom has one offer on the table from Damon for his silicone tray grip mat. , I'll be honest with you guys. My mission here is to get as many sharks to take a bite out of grip mat today as possible. What would you offer for two or three sharks? , depends on the sharks. , tell us what sharks you want. far, there's only one offer. Only one person believes in Tom. I'm not Damon. I'm not going to bid against myself. tell us what sharks you want. , obviously we have a shark that has some experience within the aviation and space industry. Look, I think you're fantastic. I think you should concentrate on what you're good at, which is developing new products and and and the product line. I'd be delighted if another shark would come with me on this. I have an idea, Richard. Yeah. , a lot about airplanes. I know a lot about cars. I see it as a big automotive industry product, but I'm going to want more equity, but I also think you're going to need more cash. What about 200,000 for 20% each for a total offer of 400,000 for 40%. [Music] Yeah, I don't think Tom is interested in giving up much equity. Start off at 200,000 at 15%. 15 15%. I'll do 200,000 at 15%. Every time I got to prove my low 200,000 15%. [Music] Tom, here's what I see. The product sells itself. Unlike most entrepreneurs, you have no fear of how it'll sell. Correct. Yes. What you're missing is infrastructure corporately. You don't have a sales guy. The more you have to deal with all that, the less time you have to do everything else. Tom, are you going to concentrate on the business as as ? You're concentrating on these three offers you have on the table. Cuz now you're talking to somebody that does not have an offer yet. You have three offers for $200,000 for 15% by each shark, Damon, Richard, and Robert. , let me let me tell you what our offer is, and I'll let you decide. Lori and I together, we're going to offer 200,000 for 20%. But here's the other part. We'll take over everything, ? We'll have inventory systems, custom delivery systems for you. , wherever you need to ship it, take over the whole thing. We'll charge you our cost . Yes. Because you'd have to pay that . . What I'll bring to the table is I already am in and have great relationships with Home Depot, Lowe's, Ace, True Value, all of that and QVC and anywhere else that I think we can get this into. I've also been in Pep Boys with my drop. What was your offer? 200,000 for 20%. . It's all you're saying that you're going to help him by finding people to do things, but you're going to charge him back at cost. he, , he might as No, we already have the people to do those things. We We've got people globally as who be happy to help. Would you do 30% at $360,000? What? 30%. 1 2 3 for $360,000. I I'll do that. I would do that. Deal. Done. Wow. Cool. You're a smart kid. Thank you, sir. Great. I'll give you a hug. Thank you. done. See, I see you.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First (ORDINAL), Salena, Ohio, the United States Air Force, Britain (GPE), F-16 (PRODUCT), 70\u00b0, 500\u00b0 (QUANTITY), roughly 10 months ago, 8 years, today (DATE)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the medium, the grip mat, a lot, the table, your tools, you guys, this problem, an open field\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seem: task\n  \u2022 believe: me\n  \u2022 cut: it\n  \u2022 introduce: Grip Mat\n  \u2022 have: sizes\n  \u2022 have: compartments\n  \u2022 have: compartments\n  \u2022 make: hats\n  \u2022 have: samples\n  \u2022 thank: you\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.18)\n\n**Topics:** shark, offer, thing, product, tool",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] First in the tank is a winter sport accessory that is functional and fashionable. [Music] Hi Sharks. My name is Kelly and I'm Christina. We're from San Francisco, California and today we're seeking $200,000 in exchange for 10% equity of our company Yard Sale. Sharks, if you've ever skied, you probably agree with us. Ski poles suck. They're clunky and easy to drop. Plus, they're made of cheap materials. They come in limited colors. And I think we can all agree, they're pretty ugly. We're lifelong skiers and know firsthand that people are constantly looking to upgrade their ski gear. But when it comes to innovation, ski poles have been , long forgotten. That's why we started Yardell. Yardell ski poles blend clever design and great style for the everyday skier. The best part about yard sale poles, they're magnetic. We've hidden magnets in the handles in the basket that they stick together, making walking to and from the car or getting on and off the lift an even easier experience. Skiers love how yard sale poles are fully modular, you can mix and match between the five eye-catching colors on our website to create your own custom pair. With yard sale, we're not only making ski days easier and more fun, but we're creating a lifestyle brand for the millions of recreational skiers out there. , Sharks, who's ready to ditch your old poles in the snow and ride the chairlifts with yard sale? , I love it. I got name. Yes. Why the name yard sale? . Haven't you ever had a yard sale on the mountain? , yeah. Kendra, are you what? Are you a black diamond skier? You don't know what a yard sale is? It's when you lose everything. Your skis come off, your poles come off. It's they call it , , a yard sale, a garage sale. does everybody that skis know that? Because it's an it's an insider term. Kendra clearly is a skier in the room and clearly I've had a lot of yard sales and it goes a bit back to the origin stories of how we came up with the idea. Christina had a infamous epic yard sale or wipeout and that's where she came up with the idea. I had a bad yard sale. It got me thinking about my greatest frustration with the product which for me is when you're carrying them. They're always crossing over. They're falling down. And I thought why has nobody put magnets on ski poles? And are you the only one doing this? Yes, we are. I started tinkering with my old poles and I taped some magnets to the handles of these. I walked around the corner to Kelly's house cuz he lives close by to me and I asked him what he thought. No one has ever in decades rethought the humble ski pole, yet every skier needs them to ski. What are your backgrounds? I've always been passionate about design and I was fortunate to follow that pursuit to MIT where I studied mechanical engineering and product design. afterwards I worked at Apple as a product designer across various teams and as an avid skier I was ready to jump into a consumer product. are you guys full-time in this? We are. We are. Yeah. my background is more on the marketing side of things. After college I worked for a hardware tech startup in marketing and then I transitioned to the venture capital side where I was the head of content and PR for a VC firm in San Francisco. One of the most important things to note as is that over 60% of our customers online customize their polls which means that we have a huge adoption. You're not doing any retail, ? , we are in a few specialty stores. , what's your price compared to a regular pole? Absolutely. , we launched 6 months ago. , and we make the product for about $30. We landed it for 42 and we sell it for$1 139. It's 75% margin. What are the average poles? Great question. We're in the upper middle range in the market. , on the lower end, you have about $50, $60 poles, which are cheap aluminum ones. But on the upper end, you have advanced poles. But we sit in the middle. And there's other pools that are, , in our range, but no one that offers features we do. What have you sold far? Yeah, great question. Yep. In the first month, , before the holidays this past year, we did $100,000 in sales in our first month. , we are fiscal year to date, , $220,000 in sales. 220. Yes. And we are forecasting to end the year, which for us ends in September, at $300,000. Next year, we're forecasting $2.1 million. Where and how did you sell them? Yeah. , we we launched DTOC only. , we'll be expanding into retail next winter, but with with who? , what was exciting is in our first 30 days, we had REI reach out to us backount decathlon in Europe. When I get new poles, I'm in the boots in the store and we're sizing and the, , we're trying to figure out exact, , the pose, ? , what happens to you? Those are a little do you need multiple different sizes of this inventory? They they come in five sizes. , but that's that's an inventory nightmare. , we got an answer for you, Mr. Wonderful. What you can see in our kids poles, which are on the far left here, is that they're adjustable and we'll have adjustable poles for adults next year as . , wait, you mean they'll continue to slide? Yeah. , , as kids grow with kids from ages 10 to 22, by the way, I don't see that out there. Let me tell you how I feel. , first of all, I don't love the name. I think it has a bit of a negative connotation and an incorrect connotation for a premium quality brand new item that's innovative. Yard sale feels it's a disaster and it's when the worst thing happens and then I'm not a skier and have to feel passionate about the product. Love the people but don't feel it here. , I'm sorry I'm out. Thank you much. I love the name. when I saw a fubu they were what is a fubu in Italian? Is it Japanese? Is it number three that on the poo poo platter? What is it? And that exactly became a conversation that stood out from everybody. how many times people come up here, their name is too close to something else and then they spend a lot of money and they lose it. They I will say it is one of the biggest reasons skiers have paid attention to our brand. I agree. I'm part of the the snowboarder community and we hate you guys. I I don't know. I don't skiing. this is not for me. I wish you all the best. Great innovation. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you, Damon. I've never skied once in my entire life and I have no intention of starting. , for those reasons, I'm out. I love this. I love the name. This is great. It's catchy, but , you're early. This is 6 months in. You're putting a $2 million valuation on a business with what you're asking. And we realized there's a high risk behind that. And one of the things that we did was we we are obviously asking for $200,000 for 10%. but we do have a lot of profit margin in our product. And therefore we do have a bit of a secondary offer in our back pocket which Mr. Wondery Mr. Wonderful we'd love to talk to you about. if you're willing we'd love to make you an offer of $200,000 for 5% with a $3 royalty until you recoup your initial investment of $200,000. That's the first time a company has ever offered to Kevin a royalty. A royalty. , we afraid of a royalty. That's a first. I would prefer to model it this way. -. I'll do the 200,000 for 20% and I'll take my chances on distributions. I want a distribution when you distribute to yourselves, but I want I want to wet my beak on this one. I want 20%. Yeah. , yes, absolutely. We'd love to talk about what Kevin would have to do to roll up his sleeves and help us. , , I don't want a job. . , you said you need somebody who's going to roll your sleeves up. Honey, I've done it. I get retail. I get omni channel. I think you have a great direct to consumer, but wholesale is where you can build this business. That's how I started Kendra Scott. I I'm going to do 20% as , plus I want the $3 back until I recoup my 200K. . Thank you. All . The difference here is I do think I can help you with this wholesale strategy. I'll drop my ass to 15%. But I'll take the $3 royalty till I get back $400,000. it's a 2x. Would you be interested in doing $200,000 for 8%. We'll drop that equity down, but we'll increase your royalty to $5 a unit until you recoup $300,000. I'll do it at 10%. I want the royalty, but I want a 2x on it. . That's going to put us in a tight position in the future. , we think at five at $5 a unit, we can get you your 300k back if you take we'll take that offer within under two years. Getting my money back is not not why I do deals. I want to get a multiple on it. Kendra, would you be interested in that a royalty offer, which is $200,000 for 8% with a $5 unit royalty until you recoup $300,000 back? what? I that. I that. I do it. Can we do 10% and you have yourself a deal? If you'll drop to 250 on the royalty payback, you got yourself a deal. It's 300. my god. $50,000 cash. Come on. Will you up the upfront cash to $250,000 at 10% with a $5 royalty until you recoup $300,000 back? Done. Done. Let's go. I'm going to come over here. I'm skiing over. Thank you much. Thank you. Thank you much. much fun. I'm going to have these everywhere I go. This is exciting. Thank you all. You skis deserve each other. That's amazing.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First, first (ORDINAL), San Francisco, California, VC (GPE), Yardell, poles, Italian, Japanese (NORP), MIT, Apple, DTOC, REI (ORG), Europe (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** yard sale, ski poles, a yard sale, a lot, the product, the name, a royalty, san francisco\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 blend: design\n  \u2022 create: custom pair\n  \u2022 create: lifestyle brand\n  \u2022 love: it\n  \u2022 get: name\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 call: it\n  \u2022 do: everybody\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n  \u2022 have: yard sale\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.15)\n\n**Topics:** pole, sale, yard, royalty, skier",

We're from Cleveland, Ohio. And we're the founders of Sauce Moto. Today we're here to offer you a 15% stake in our company for $45,000. Since the advent of the drive-thru, we've all been faced with a horrible decision when eating in our cars. What's that, Mike? Risk fumbling, making a mess with your dipping sauce, or heaven forbid, having to eat a ketchupless fry. That's disgusting. And we could not stand for this any longer. That's why we took fate into our own hands and molded from the clay of the earth the Saus Moto dip clip. A condiment holder designed specifically for your car. Sauce Moto isn't a cup holder for your sauce. No, it's a purveyor of freedom. It's universal clip attaches to about any vehicle's air vent. And its unique 5in-1 aperture holds sauce from about all fast food restaurants. Bravo. Bravo. . Through extensive field testing and countless nights of grueling fast food research, we developed Sausoto to hold up to about any road condition. Sharks, don't try this at home. You want to go for a ride? Yes, I'm starving. Let's say you're enjoying your nuggets when the driver suddenly turns onto a cobblestone path. , and suddenly a strong gust of wind comes from the east. It's hardly ideal dipping conditions, but not with Sauce Moto. That's . Any sauce, any climate, Sauce Moto has your nuggets covered. Together, we can make the ketchupless fry a thing of the past. It's time to practice safe sauce. , Sharks, who wants to dip into this investment and make sure no one has to endure a sauceless nugget again. Who's hungry? , yeah. And a bent, too. Yes. , thank you. More food. what I need. See that? These nuggets are great. Yeah, these nuggets are great. , how did you come up with this? About 10 years ago, we were on a road trip, got hungry, decided to get some nuggets and fries, and the inevitable happened, and I spilled some sauce in Tony's brand new car, and that's when we started brainstorming. , how how could we keep them secure? , , in the car. You thought this was a big problem? It is. It is a problem. It is catch. How many of these have you sold? , we've done 12,000 units for about $77,000 in sales. Wow. I'm curious. Are you excited to be here? I'm not sure I'm feeling any pulse. No, I am excited to be here. , I we work hard on this. This is Tony's natural voice. What is your role in this business? Each of our roles. . , yeah, I'm the engineer. I designed most of it here. , testing and your design, your marketing. Tony and I I span between both. I'll I'll from from design and creative. I'll do any the graphic design. We do everything in house. Most of the product testing too, ? And who? yeah. And who designed this package? I did. Fabulous design. It tells you everything you want to see. Doesn't take up any space. I even want to have one. I don't even eat fast food. That's the reaction we usually get is when people see it, they're take my money. what does it cost? What did you sell them for? We're selling them for about 5.75 on, , our website and online. it cost us about 80 cents to make. What's your background? I'm a sales engineer in the tire industry. I'm a mechanical engineer doing product development for a wood tool company. I I own a couple of bars. , you do? Good for you. In Cleveland? Yeah, I've probably been there. My people are going to find you. We knew that nugget culture is real. Nugget culture. Absolutely. We built this for verality. We did the amazing videos and those went viral. We had 44 million views over Facebook. Do you guys expect to sell millions of these? Stanford study concluded that there's 20% of American meals are consumed in automobiles. Wow. I eat probably 30% of mine. And there's a lot of Yeah, there's a lot of people who don't have time to go home and sit down and have a lunch. , one of the biggest things that we've realized with Sausoto is it's an extremely good promotional tool for companies. , if we approached a fast food chain, rental car companies, we were in talks with two major sauce manufacturers now for promotional product. I think you guys are taking this the wrong direction. It's not nuggets. It's all about the fries. Everybody eats fries. I the deal cuz I can see taking it public on the NYC. You'll be ringing the bell with me. I think this is huge. But wait a sec. Maybe there's a smoking hot offer coming here. I do see the use of it. , I eat fries in the car and I to dip my fries and it's an issue. But , I've got to wet my beak. I got to wet my beak. You want a lot of money here. This is $45,000. We're not messing around. 15%. This imputes a crazy valuation. that. But I'm willing to go, but I want a little bit more equity. I'll do it for 50%. , thank you, Kevin. Thank you. Appreciate that offer. You want to be at the drive up window and they say, Look, for an extra whatever, you can get the sauce moto. This is cool. You clip your sauce into it. That's where you want to be. That's complicated deal. That's a complicated deal to cut. They give it away as a promotion. Thank goodness you went cuz that's the deal I to take on as a challenge. Look, I think it's a great product, but you've already found out, you're going to have to hustle for big sales across, , promotional opportunities. that that's a lot of time and it doesn't get me all sauced up. And for those reasons, I'm out. It's such a little product. It's such a small price. Don't let these sharks drop out. No. No. And this my price is going way up. If these guys drop out, shut up a minute. It's going way up to the door. Three grown men sharing the potential profit of this tiny little product. This isn't my business. I'm sorry. I'm out. I have one final question. Who created the videos that saw 44 million hits? We wrote the scripts and we hired a crew to film them. How much did it cost you to make however many videos you made for 44 million views? $4,000. $4,000. Wow. You got to be kidding me. We $4,000. You are in the wrong business. Am I getting all the products you guys create going forward? Going forward. Absolutely. Yes. I get the dream team. Yes, of course you'd complete the dream team. , guys, I'm going to help you out here, ? Cuz that's the guy I am. I'll give you 45,000 for 40%. I got to tell you, it's the team. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I love the three of you. You guys are an ability to create the videos and the marketing. I think there's a great product within you. This may or may not be it, but I'll go along for the ride. , I'll tell you what I'm willing to do. You got a third, a third, a third. If I come in as a partner, a important one that's willing to work hard on this, I'll do it if I get 25% that we're all equal.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a way for people with common interests to find each other. [Music] A Hi Sharks. I'm Nathan. And I'm Sterling. And I'm Lee from New Orleans, Louisiana. We're seeking $300,000 for 20% equity in our company Tabby. Sharks. You may not believe it, but these handsome men have been ripped to shreds on general dating apps. All because of something they love. Here are real messages these successful, passionate guys have gotten on general dating apps. My friend says you have four cats. That's four red flags. Do you sleep with that thing? Would you be willing to give up your cats for me? Studies show that men who have cats in their profile photos perform worse and get fewer matches on general dating apps. That's why we created Tabby, the cat person's dating app. All , boys. Go be yourselves. Tabby is a safe space. Tabby is a familiar dating app. You swipe left or you swipe on people, but it also has a specific area asking you about your cats, how much do you spend on your cat a month or does he or she sleep in the bed with you every night? Of course she does. All my cats do. . Tabby also provides a community space for everyone on the app, the cat tree, where you can share your favorite cat friendly cafe or suggest date ideas volunteering at Sterling's nonprofit or curling up with me and my four kitties and a nice bottle of wine. , Sharks say goodbye to these local adoptable kittens for now. The boys will be back. and join us as we help people determine who they want to spend the rest of their nine lives with based on their love for cats with Tabby Lee. It seems crazy to me. How did you come up with this idea? , , I started a different dating app a few years ago. I first started Dig, the dog person's dating app. After growing that with my sister for a few years, we are now in acquisition conversations with a dog food company. Wow. Over those few years, we heard from a lot of cat people. One of the things we learned was that there aren't places dog parks for cat people to go out and meet each other. And there's this stigma around cat people. That's terrible. Are the rest of you guys doing dig also? , no. We're strictly here on Tabby. , both of us work as social media influencers. I work as Nathan the cat lady, as you can see by the cutout behind me. And then I met Sterling at one of the cat conventions and we hit it off. I go by Sterling Trap King Davis. Trap King named after my cat rescue nonprofit. I am one of one. Cat rescue is usually something done by middle-aged white women. I am the only black man that you will see that sold everything and lives out of his vehicle and rescue cats. Good for you. How many cat owners are there in the first place? Great question. 17 million single cat owners in the US. A lot of people don't know how many cat people are out there cuz most of us are ashamed to come out with it. I am a cat lover. I do not understand why there is cat shame at all. Why is there cat shame? I I have no idea. Cuz it's not cool. Lori knock your cat down the street. There is some statistics. When did you get started? How many people are using the app? What have you learned far? , last summer we had the opportunity to launch Tabby because we won the Milliondoll dating project. What is that? It is a grant from a dating platform company and they gave us $50,000 in equityfree grant money to be able to market the platform and we could use their platform, put our branding on it, then market from there. We launched on International Cat Day on this pre-made platform. Of course you did. When we launched, , there were a massive amount of problems on the platform. , good. I hate when that happens. Yes. When we first launched, that platform had all of the development made. We brought our branding. They built something that was built to the web and wasn't exactly made for mobile. And it's , , we we went into , you gave us the excuses. Now, get to the numbers. . Sure. We had 31,000 users on the app. We made $43,000 in revenue. 17,000 of that was from subscriptions and 25,000 of that was from our first integration partner. And then since then we've not been marketing as we've been building out the next version of Tabby. And are you still on their platform? What I wanted to do was come to you guys today and tell you we want to switch to a new platform. That urgency increased entirely in the past few days when they terminated our contract early. , good. It is hitting the fire since then because of all the issues especially we went out and we sourced the best team. We built an entirely new app with our new development team. . , that's great. , but when are you ready to release? It's already under review by Apple now. , it should whenever they're done in the next two weeks. Is it a monthly subscription? Yes, it's $19.99 a month and it is that expensive or not? in the dating industry now. That's not extraordinarily expensive for a startup for regular premium subscriptions. How much money have you raised to this point? For Tabby, we've raised no money other than the equity grant. See, to me, that's the problem, ? Because you had to funnel everything and do everything on this other platform for $50,000. That's impossible. And now here you are scrambling. As Narv will tell you and all of us will tell you, growing an app is difficult, competitive, and expensive unless you find a unique niche, , and maybe you guys can make it take off virally, but it's , hard. And , for those reasons, I'm out. Look, I wish you all the best. Anytime you can connect people and animals and create more love in the world, it's it's a wonderful thing. But it's not for me. I'm out. understand. What we have now is the car, the keys, the map, the drivers. We need the rocket fuel to be able to take off, ? You got no gas and you got no money for gas. We would love some money for gas. We all love the passion, but I will tell you from starting next door and growing it to over 50 million registered users, it's , difficult to get distribution. You need to find a way to break through the noise of all those existing dating apps and make a name for yourself. I think you probably have a long way to go to build a breakthrough tech app. And for those reasons, I'm out. Let me take a stab at it this way. I invested in a deal called Base Pause at a 2 million valuation. We're raising 10 million at a 40 million valuation now. And she has built a huge database of cat owners. We may have the largest cat database in America. And I have become a cat lover because it has cash flow. I love cash flow. Cat flow. Cat flow. , here's an offer for you. And this is the way I'm thinking of structuring. Wow. Did not see this coming. I'm going to offer you $300,000 for 30%. . It may be better if you had maybe America's biggest cat database on your side. That's my offer. That's a good offer, guys. You're starting from scratch here. That's a great offer. That is a great offer. Would you consider doing 25% and meeting us in the middle? No is my answer. The problem for me is I'm not a tech app app expert. , that's not my background or my thing. I don't have as much to offer. I hate saying this because Kevin does have that company based Paws where I think could be helpful to you. And because I want to do the best for cats that I possibly can, I will step aside for the cat hater. But who can be the cat helper? What a lot of noise. I'm out. Thank you, Lori. Kevin's giving you cash plus distribution because a partnership with his company will give you traffic and that's the only thing you need when you start this company. You have everything else, Kevin. It sounds a perfect deal and we'd love to take it and work with you. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Yay. That's absolutely fantastic. Thank you much. Let's have some fun with this. Thank you. It's great. Nice meeting you guys, too. a lot of social workers. Thank you. Thank you much. Thank you much. [Music] I knew there'd be one. That's what I'm talking about, baby. Let's go. Let's go. Is wonderful. Kevin, I think you're going to help her. What I see is you promoting the app with a picture of you with a hairless cat. I want you to understand something. I am building a cat empire. Yes. I'm the king of the litter.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** New Orleans, Louisiana, US, America (GPE), 300,000, us $50,000, 43,000, 19.99, 50,000 (MONEY), 20%, 30%, 25% (PERCENT), Sterling, Nathan, Sterling Trap King Davis, Apple, Narv (ORG), first (ORDINAL), International Cat Day (EVENT)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the app, general dating apps, a lot, cat people, you guys, a way, your cats, your cat\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 300,000\n  \u2022 believe: it\n  \u2022 create: Tabby\n  \u2022 swipe: left\n  \u2022 provide: community space\n  \u2022 say: goodbye\n  \u2022 join: us\n  \u2022 start: dating app\n  \u2022 start: Dig\n  \u2022 be: stigma\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.17)\n\n**Topics:** cat, app, people, tabby, platform",

For centuries, scholars have tried to answer the age-old question, which came first, the chicken or the egg? , we're here to tell you nobody cares now that our devild eggs are here. Hi, Sharks. My name is Rachel Van Buskerk. And I'm Alexi Wellman. And we are Devil Egg Company, the first and only company in the world to specialize in gourmet, uniquely flavored devild eggs tailored to taste your favorite foods. We've taken the most notorious appetizer in history and flipped it upside down to create something truly extraordinary. These are definitely not your grandma's devild eggs. Each one of our mind-blowing recipes has a different flavored yolk, fresh real toppings, and the perfect combination of creamy and crunch for a one-of-a-kind egg experience. , from our mouthwatering cheeseburger to our chicken Caesar salad to even chicken and waffles, what we have all the flavors for you to egg explore. And our menu offers gluten-free, dairyfree, and vegetarian options, all made to order and sure to exceed those egg expectations. , Sharks, we're here seeking $150,000 and your egg expertise in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, enough yolking around. Who's ready to make an exuberant amount of cash with these good eggs? Sharks, in front of you are some of our top selling eggs. You have in front of you the chicken Caesar salad. In the middle, you should have the crab rangon. And on the left, you should have our cheeseburger. And then we also provided you a half pint of our smoked salmon devild egg salad. , this is good. It's good. I love devild eggs. Love. do I. do we. This is fantastic. Yeah, this is good. How do you make them? They're incredible. They don't taste devild eggs. , it's years in the making. , my obsession started back in 2017. I stumbled upon this niche that nobody had capitalized on. And now, seven years later, I know why. It's a lot of work. up on the screen. We saw what looked a menu. Are you a store? Are you online? Where do you sell this? , , we, , bought our first food trailer in, , 2020. It was a, , born out of the pandemic. A lot of people said I was a little bit crazy. It is devil eggs. My mom's , \"Go back to school.\" , but, , but yeah, we got our first little food trailer and we used that the spring and summer of 2021 to test the market, generate a little bit of revenue. Where you based? originally out of Omaha, Nebraska where we still have a actual full service restaurant and then I reside in now north of Dallas, Dennis, Texas. Why did you choose to go from the food truck to a restaurant? We started with the food truck to ch show proof of concept. , what we've been doing is intentional with our growth. We got the reaction exactly you guys are and that was , , we're on to something. Let's open a store. What we figured out is that the full restaurant model has low margins compared to where we go now, which is more of the graband-go models and you you order there and they're made to order and they come these, but you can also buy these in egg salad. And we also do shipping. How many eggs would a typical customer buy? I think it would always as an appetizer, not a meal. The average order is going to be our six-pack. We do a two pack, six-pack, and a 12-pack. , our six-pack cost average is about a $181 cost of goods and we sell it for anywhere from 14.99 to 179. That's a meal. You eat six half eggs. That's a lot high protein. , this restaurant only sells deiled eggs and the kitted product in the jar. . Our graband go. , our first two restaurants are more full service. We believe the graband go is the to- go, which needs how many square feet? It needs about 600 ft. We're at a 900 foot space there. What are your sales? We opened the first store in 2021. Sales were 60,000. In 22 they were 395,000. Nice. In 23 they were 492,000. Wow. This year we already have 705,000 to date and we're looking at hitting 1.3 million for this year. Wow. on this million3, are you going to make any money? Yes. We're forecasting about 350 to 380,000 in revenue with putting at least 50,000 to the bottom line. Where that becomes interesting, it took only 50,000 to build that out plus inventory. that's a return in a year of the capital. I got to tell you, , this is probably the best thing I've ever eaten in 16 years on this stage. Wow. That I enjoy. Yeah. Thank you. , that I enjoy that's not sinful. I've eaten a lot of stuff. Not as much as I have. Yeah. I'm telling you, this is not my area of expertise. I think there's other sharks up here who will make sure that you are successful in the event that you get a deal. With that being said, I'm out. Thank you much for your feedback. How are you going to expand your business? , , , , what we're we're asking that 150,000. We do plan to use part of those funds to open up two more graband-go models. Are you interested in franchising it? We have people that want to franchise it already. in new concepts, which is what you are, interesting new concept. To prove it out, you need at least four to five stores, you got to hit close to 5 million in sales and then you're worth for funding 1x sales. That's what new concepts are getting funded at now. you're saying 150 or 5% imputes 3 million. That's not going to happen. Not that it isn't a great idea. It's that's not realistic. If this concept sticks, and I think it can. I know it can. Can I take the floor for a moment? I I have due respect for him, but he's thinking the wrong way on this. , you've already proven your concept and your numbers. You have figured out the franchise model. I invested in crispy cones. I guess it was two seasons ago. They had one company owned store. They sold 66 franchises in six months because they had one store that was making in Orlando, Florida a million dollars a year. Wow. Which seems incredible. , what do you want to do, Barb? I'll give you 150 for 15%. That's what I own in Crispy Cones. That's what I own in Cousins's mane lobster. And Cousins Main Lobster has 900 million in sales. And I get up in the morning excited at 15%. , thank you. Thank you, Barbara. Don't think about it too long. No, we're not. , we do want to be respectful because this is our one and only chance. I did not expect to love this, but do I have to invest in everything I love or can I be a great customer? I'm going to be a great customer because I adore it and I love you, but I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you much for your feedback and your time. Yes. I'll make you an offer 150 for 20%. I don't think this is a good franchise because it's low cost to open up. , if you guys think bigger, I wouldn't franchise anything. Would you be interested in considering the shipping side of this thing on your platform? , let me give you an example. , I'm Chef Wonderful on QVC. I don't know how we could ship 25,000 orders. I'm not feeling love lately. No, no. I'm looking at you. We've got your love. Yes. What are you doing, Mark? I definitely love it. . And you definitely love You better not compete with me, my dear Mark. , you go in with me otherwise. It's, , , give them more money to get bigger percent. , yeah, that's a good idea. I don't What percentage are you What's the most you're willing I'm willing to put in some more money to get it we can get up to 20%. I I we would love if we could get 250,000 because it would help us to open a couple more% for 20%. I would do that. I would do that too. Done. Deal. [Music] That is great. We now got Daddy Warbucks with us and we got somebody who knows franchising. , it's perfect. You guys are all awesome. Thank you for presentation. Great presentation. You did.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is an innovation to an ancient art [Music] form. Hi Sharks, I'm Joel Pennington, the founder and CEO of Black Dot. Sharks, there's a multi-billion dollar industry that hasn't seen much by way of innovation in over 5,000 years. And the first client on record was Oatsie the Iceman. I'm talking about the tattoo industry. And while people are getting more tattoos and at a faster rate than ever before, there's a significant portion of the population that has been considering a tattoo, but is hesitant because of concerns around pain, design choices. Moreover, with social media, people are now able to see what top tattoo artists the world over are able to offer. And as a result, many tattoo seekers end up wanting to work with a tattoo artist that is out of reach. Black Dot has solved all of these issues and more. We've recently introduced the world's first automatic tattooing device paired with an online marketplace for high-end tattoo art. Licensed designs are uploaded into our platform and the Black Dot device tattoos at a level of precision that hasn't existed until now. We use fantastically small black dots, roughly the size of a human hair, as the pixel to create our tattoos. With Black Dot, we've created something that's scalable. Sharks, it's time to roll up your sleeves and for $1.5 million for 5% equity. How is that all? You can join Black Dot and be a part of the tattoo revolution. Joel, do you have a business behind this? We do. what we've done here is I This is fake skin, synthetic skin, and these are tattoos by the black dot device. . I figured this was it's down to a fine level. when you look at this here, it's extremely fine. Do tattoo artists hate you. Some do. , yeah, because you take their jobs. , that's not necessarily the case. Here's how it works. First of all, when we license designs, we license them from tattoo artists as as visual artists. And every time every tattoo artist, every time a t a licensed tattoo is executed, that artist gets paid. , for tattoo artists, for the first time ever, we're enabling them to scale in an industry with a low ceiling. now, they trade time for money. Yeah. I'm into the tattoos. I got over $300,000 worth of ink on my body. Do you ? Do you ? I do. I do. Because my tattoo artist is one of the top in the world, Arlo. And he's expensive. Wow. What is your business model? give me the breakdown. First of all, this company was founded in 2019. We're venture-backed. I've raised 4.5 million to date. , we launched the company formerly in October of last year. And what we've done is we had three different artists to prove the power of the platform. the first artist we worked with Omar Tuna. He's a top artist out of Istanbul. he created a special exclusive collection for Black Dot. And for his tattoos, they range in the $2,000 to $3,000 price point. Is that expensive for a tattoo? Damon, how much would a one of your tattoos have cost? Because he had to do it by the hour, ? One of my tattoos is 70,000. . why wouldn't we? Yeah. The next artist that we worked with was Tyler Hobbs. And Tyler Hobbs is the number one generative artist in the world. Generative art is using algorithms and code to create work. His pieces that are in print, they're all six figures. They sell at Surbes, Christies. , he's tip of the spear. . And the price points for his tattoos, $9,875 from your machine, from our device. You can make a h 100,000 of those, ? No, now we're supply constrainted. We're based in Austin, Texas. I have one black dot device, ? I don't have a fleet. Is there more pain or less pain? People rate it as two out of 10 on a pain scale. The average whereas a traditional tattoo is 5 to eight. what are you selling us here today? , originally, , the business plan was to be able to create our own studios, Black Dot Studios, owned and operated. But now, now that I've been out talking to the investors, we've only pivoted the business recently to make the Black Dot device available to tattoo studios. Do you purchase one? Do you lease one? , he only has one. The plan, the model that probably makes more sense is to lease it. What does it cost to make a machine? What do you sell it for? And please talk about revenue. I'm dying over here. We have to , it's not much, ? But go ahead. because you have one machine. now our internal cost is about 120,000 to be able to build the device. , that's why you want to lease them though, ? Because it's expensive to get any type of markup. It's going to be difficult for third parties to come in. 130,000 is what I'm doing with my engineering team now. As soon as you have a contract manufacturer, we have line of sight to be able to Sorry. We have line of sight to be able to get this down to about $50,000 per unit. One machine. How many tattoos have you made with it? , we've made over a hundred. How many paying clients? Most of them are test people as we've been testing the product. . , we know 120 to 30,000 to make it to make the device. If I wanted to buy it, I have my own tattoo shop and I want to buy it. I don't have a price for you now. We've only recently been able to make this transition to be able to lease it. , what have you spent the four million on? If you don't have a business plan and exceptionally hard to be able to do all my team on the engineering side are all Johns Hopkins PhD. Yeah. Look, it is hard. machine essentially. It took that long. Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There is no business plan. You want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a journey of chaos with you? All sharks are still in, but they are struggling to understand Joel's business plan for his robotic tattoo company, Black Dot. Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There is no business plan. You want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a journey of chaos with you? That's not fair at all. In fact, all , before we go off on a tangent before, , let the hard part and by the way, there's patents. We have four issued patents. , what we're trying to do is get a real feel for how you would grow the business. , what you're telling me is we'll give you the benefit of the doubt. $50,000 to make a machine. You're going to then lease it to others. You're going to charge how much? Because you had to have done this math, , to figure out if the internal math that I have. Yep. What is the revenue per machine per month? On an annual basis, it's roughly a million dollars and margins on that were 79%. But you don't know because you simp. Let's oversimplify it. I get a machine. I'm a tattoo shop. I run $2,000 a day on tattoos. $10,000 a week, $40,000 a month tattoo. , . , let's say that thing is running about an hour, ? And you're you're open 8 hours. , that's the model on probably how much a shop can do with the machine. How do you get paid? , what we would do is , you'd have a a flat rate presumably for a leasing piece. , they would be able to go ahead and put their own artwork in it to be able to use it. There's probably a subscription service for being able to go ahead and leverage that. And then there's in all likelihood a marketplace. the marketplace that we've designed which they would have access to as . We get a piece of that as as the contributing artist. Joel, Joel, Joel, can can I jump in for a second? Let me say something about this that is rubbing me the wrong way. There are three levels. It's go to product phase and then it's go to market phase and then it's go to scale phase. I love the go to scale phase because now you have a product, what your market is and you ramp up. you're still in product phase and this costs a lot of money to build a two-sided market while simultaneously building these machines and raising all of this capital. But because of the complexity here and the stage that you're at, unfortunately, I'm out. You are here early. You don't have any of this worked out yet. I feel you are figuring out what you're even going to do. What even is the business model? You're asking for a tremendous amount of money when you don't have any factual support at a $30 million valuation. At a $30 million valuation, I'm sorry. I'm out. . Thank you, Joel. I'm going to grade you on this presentation. In terms of presenting a market that we've never looked at this way on Shark Tank in 16 years that's large, I'm going to give you a 10. I'm going to give you a negative six on presentation skills because you're all over the map. I'm being honest with you. You've got to deliver some essence of a pathway to where I give you a million5 and somehow I get it back times X maybe 10, 20, 30 times. That's why I'm an investor. But because you chose such a large number, a million five, I got to have some essence of a plan. Has to be buttoned up. And and you didn't deliver on that. nice guy. interesting idea. And if I was going to get a tattoo, I'd want this machine cuz I I level two pain, not 10. I get that. But but you sucked in terms of presentation. I'm out. Yeah, Joe, I don't think you were that bad. But here's what I think you did leave out. Once you pivoted to having a machine, you talked about the end user as opposed to the customer who is a tattoo shop or somebody who wants to open up one, ? and identifying the value to them because they're the ones that have to make the hardest decisions. And you have to be able to model all that out to sell them and you didn't get into any of that in terms of the economic benefit to them we can understand the economic benefit to us and that's what was missing because that's still confusing and uncertain. I'm out. , fair enough. Thank you. You're welcome. Yep. Damon. Damon. Mr. Tattoo. Yeah. Woo. , I think every single shark here hit all the valid points, but I see I see such a massive opportunity here because the tattoo market is a massive massive opportunity. And Mark was in there. How would I do that as a shop? You didn't define that. Added to what the other sharks said about a $30 million valuation. It's it's extremely hard for us to participate in this. I love this idea. much opportunity here. many challenges at the same time. Yeah, fair enough. I'm out. We wish you the best, Joel. good luck. Good luck.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a safe way to deal with a nasty little problem. [Music] Hi Sharks. I'm Steve Abrams and I'm Olivia Abrams. We're a fatherdaughter duo from upstate New York. We're here today seeking a bite-size investment of $250,000 for 10% of our company, Tikmitt, where we're not afraid to tick off ticks. Sharks. Ticks are small, nasty bugs that can do a lot of harm. They carry potentially life-threatening diseases, including Lyme disease. Before tick, the only option for prevention was a bottle full of chemicals whose names you can't pronounce. That's disgusting. Or tweezers. Ow. But they're only good after they embed. And then you're playing Russian roulette with your health. That's why we created TickMint, the ultimate tick check accessory. It finds and removes even the tiniest ticks from yourself, your loved ones, and your pets before they embed and transmit diseases. wipe TikT over your skin, your clothes, your pet's fur, and TikT will remove any loose ticks. Then place Tikmitt in the included dryer bag in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill the ticks. And Tikmitt is ready to be used again. With our big dogs, it was a challenge keeping ticks out of the house. But with Tikmitt, I no longer have to worry about ticks hanging out on the couch with me watching Shark Tank. Ew. Tikmitt provides a simple solution for families to enjoy the outdoors safely. sharks, who wants to help us scale tickmitt worldwide and make every adventure worry-f free? Those are your samples in front of you. We have five different colors. How does such a soft fabric this remove the ticks? it works on the theory of velcro. Ticks are all hooks. This is a patented microfiber. , the loop sizes is what the patent is around. if the loops are too big, the ticks don't get stuck in it. If they're too small, they can't get in at all. , it's designed to work on ticks that are, , nymphs to adult and all different species. How did you even come think that that was a possibility? , when I was seven years old, I started having bad arthritis in my knee. I couldn't walk and eventually I got a bad rash on my face and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. And it wasn't until my dad said to the doctor, Hey, we live in an area with ticks. I ended up testing positive for Lyme disease, went through about six months of physical therapy and have made a strong recovery because we caught it pretty early and since then we've always been concerned about it. we started working with a tick scientist and a product engineer and after 13 iterations we came up with this product. Isn't there a pill that's supposed to repel them? Yes. the way that the pill works is it's an oral medication you give to your dog monthly. , if a tick does bite your dog, it means that your dog's not going to get sick. But again, it doesn't stop the tick from coming into your home or getting into your car. Yes. But can you do everything ? , don't most people miss things. , you can capture most of it, but how do you make sure you're comprehensive? We've been working with a tick scientist, and it picks up between 90 and 95%. There's always a chance you're going to miss one. We're not making that claim that you're getting 100%. I never wanted to know this much about TI, but what we want to know is, is there a business here? Yes, there is a business. , we were recently at the outdoor retailer trade show and on 137 submissions, we won innovation product of the year. That has led to 70 conversations with big box stores, which means you're ready to talk about the business. That's . , we've been in business 18 months. We've done 432,000 in sales. Wow. Good for you. , what have you done year to date? 252 this year. You are the tick whisperer. The tick chick. What What's your background? I'm the classic entrepreneur. Dropped out of college, started businesses. My last business was a business called Magnolia Bakery in New York City, one store, and took it to 14 countries and then sold it. next to Radio City Music Hall. That's it. And I'm an only child to a family of entrepreneurs and I went to school for entrepreneurship, worked in finance for a couple of years. then you went tick crazy. , I was already a little bit tick crazy before that because of the lime scene. , , a classic entrepreneur in the back of my head is that's a business one day. , I wanted to go back to business, Steve, cuz I'm freaking out about your valuation. You're not worth two and a half million bucks. You don't even I'll tell you why. We've already got our patent and our IP filed in Great Britain and EU. are about to launch in 15 countries. Was this the utility patent that you were and design? Yes, both. , you have to file in each country and in each country it's thousands and thousands of dollars and then certain countries it takes 20 years to get the patent. Patent pending gives you the protection until you get it. But patent pending doesn't technically give you any protection. But what we found going to all of these shows, we've learned how big the problem is worldwide. And there's also a huge occupational hazard. people who are firefighters, policemen, land surveyors, and the Boy Scouts of America. Steve, how much do you own money do you have invested? Over 600,000. Wow. Damn. what do you sell them for? What do they cost you to make? 164 to make, 215 landed. Sells for $19.99. , there's some margins there. 70% of our sales this year have been between Amazon and our website. Half and half. 15% has was wholesale and distribution. And then we also did a flash sale. You know your stuff. But this was the first year we went to shows. It was eye opening. First it showed us it was a worldwide market. We have 10 shows lined up next year and every You can't do shows. This should be all over social media. We have about 6,500 followers, but we're getting, , almost a million impressions a month. We had a video go viral. It has 7 million views. Hey, hey guys, let me get it started. Look, I can't think of anything better in life than starting a business with your daughter, ? I get to see her all the time. But let me tell you guys, wherever there's ticks, I'm going the opposite direction. I'm the tick avoider. It's not a fit for me. Congratulations. I love to see it. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you. You must be incredibly proud of her. She's bam, bam, bam. Every question, every answer, it all. The hard thing for me is my company bug bite thing. They want to get into the tick space. And the problem is I have to remain loyal to them. I think you're going to do great though. I wish you great success, but I'm out. Thank you. We appreciate it. We understand. I think it's a great product. I question how many people going to use it because I forget about all that stuff when I go in the house. , it's not for me. I'm out. , understand. Thank you. I'm a perfect tick girl. I almost lost my son to Lyme disease when he was two and a half. Wow. I didn't know what was wrong. High fever, hardly breathing, I know the dangers of it. I also have had many ticks myself. If I'm not feeling , I assume I have a tick. Exactly. Yes. Would you take 250,000 for 30%. No. 20. I think that's a little bit higher than we wanted to go. We would do it for 20. 30. It's a lot of work, let me tell you. We know. To get all the deals at the big box stores, to keep your eye on them, to the chargebacks, it's not satisfying work. But 30% is too rich for us. That's a no. It's a no. I would look at this deal, but there it's not a company yet. It's a product. And , how do I get my 250 back? I don't want to tie up 250,000 for 10 years while we wait for what? Tick mitt public listing. I don't want to tie up my money for 10 years. , I'm I'll make you an offer. You may not it, but it's the only way I would do this deal. I do the 250 for 20% a buck a unit as a royalty, I get some a distribution. Where does it end? I can't have it in perpetuity. The margins on the distributors would make that too tight. What about leave the royalty in place until I get back 2 million? That's an eight time multiple. That doesn't make sense. Why not? Makes sense to me. Of course it does. Yeah. , that's I would invest with you if you gave me that deal. I , look, I've structured zillions of deals this on single products and I would do that deal 250,000 20% a buck a unit till I make I make back 2 million bucks. Thank you. But that won't work for us. Am I clear and understanding that you weren't interested in my 250? Yeah. Or 30%. Would Would you do it for 25%. No. We're not We cannot get to 30. No. I'm out. Thank you. I think these offers reflect how nissent and how early this is. Maybe we're not telling the story enough. No, you are fully understand. I believe you are the tick kings. I believe that. It's we know how much work is involved. No, I I get that. . , you don't my offer, I understand. You don't have to take it. I'm out. Good luck, guys. We appreciate the effort.

I'm from Bethesda, Maryland, and I'm asking $200,000 for 5% of my company, Smart Girls. Sharks. We can all agree that the latest robots and drones are super cool, but let's face it, it's a boys market and it's not of interest to girls. In addition, in the US, we have a major shortage of engineers in male-dominated workforce. , how do we encourage more girls into science, technology, engineering, and math? We show them how fun technology can be by integrating it into the toys they already play with. I would to introduce you to Smart Girl Sigi, the world's first coding robot for girls. [Music] Hi guys. Hello. Super cute, huh? , Smart Girl Siggy is a selfbalancing hoverboard that carries any 11in fashion doll. You can connect with it with any smart device, including phone and tablet. Using our sugarcoated proprietary app, you can start coding with a touch of a button. Today, our smart girls are going to show us a dance they coded using our sugarcoated appet. [Music] Me and my girls take it on the world. Make it world. We can take over the world. We've been waiting. But it's mag. [Music] That was amazing, girl. Good job, girls. Good job. sharks, who's going to join me and make all girls smart girls? Can I come? if you want to come on up, we will show you how to code. how does it work? And as I mentioned, Siki carries any 11in fashion doll. we made you a Richard Branson doll. Here you go. And you all we have Shark Tank dolls for all of you. Shall we give some samples to the sharks? If I may say, it's flattering. It looks about 20 years younger. you look good there. Thank you. It's fantastic. Oo, I this. Look how buff I look. , look at Robert. Yes, I look Matt Damon. Wow, Lori, you look amazing. That's you. And and we put you in a gorgeous velvet suit. That's me with hair. , Charie, the siggy is the segue Exactly. This is cool. , we're doing puzzle one and it says to move 50 cm forward at 25% speed. you are going to change the speed by tapping here to 25. Yep. And next change the amount of centimeters from 25 to 50. 50. And now you are going to drag and drop the codes. First the speed. . And next we're going to drive on floor to see if we got it . And now how to code. Yay. You did it. You're such a geek, Richard. You're great teachers. Thank you. How old are you? I'm 10. You're 10. And I'm nine. And do you find it easy or hard to do? It's easy. Sometimes for a beginner, you can find it hard, but when you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. To what degree can they if they get more advanced, can they enter the commands? Yeah, we've allowed for kids to also see the code that they've made. you can see the JavaScript you've created. it's learning your ABCs before you start, , writing novels. How did you come up with this idea? My daughter was struggling in math. I was , what can I do? And then I walked into her room and I I saw this line of dolls and I thought, can I connect robots and dolls together and make something that's more inspiring for her? And and that's how Smart Girls was created. That was two years ago. And what was your next step to do that? . , making something self-balancing is difficult. That's why you had to get it moving first. Yeah. Exactly. And we spent almost a year doing the mathematics on this. And our significant e-learning platform app, Sugarcoated, is special in the sense that we put girls in the center. It's story based. And did you release this onto the market yet? We've only been on the market for less than 6 months. . And we've done $250,000 worth of sales in that short period of time. How did you get your sales? the first thing that I did was I went to the World's Toy Fair with six prototypes. I walked away with 300 names of different companies who were interested in the product and I thought, what, this is going to this is going to be big. then I started to talk to some of them and I was able to get some distributor agreements and that helped me raise the funds. the 250,000 is from one distributor, a couple of distributors. It's for distributors, also direct from retail, also from Amazon. where is it now, Sherman? Where can I see the It's available online on our website. What does it sell for? I don't think we ever asked you. Yeah, it sells for $79.99. And what does it cost you to make it? About $18 landed. Wow, that's great. Let us know why you think the company's worth $4 million at this point. One of the things is how difficult it is to do the balancing algorithm and it makes it special. We can license or sell the balancing algorithm. It's unique. I tell you that self balancing thing is cool. Doesn't it look Richard met Lori? , hey, you want some tea? Is this a patent on this? This this We have a provisional patent on our product. , I think this is valuable because out of the young ladies that do go into engineering, 70% end up dropping out of engineering because they don't have other females. they can relate to. And I think if you get them in early enough, they will have more females. I'm interested in licensing this thing out, but you're asking a lot. I would have to give you the 200,000 for 30%. All sharks are still in. Damon is interested in Smart Girls, an engineering toy geared towards girls, but he wants a much bigger stake of the company than the 5% Charie came in offering. I would have to give you the 200,000 for 30%. . Wow, that's that's a lot. , , been in the toy business, the Barbie doll, the 800 lb gorilla in that business. Sales have declined the last couple of years, but they're still , one is sold every 3 seconds, there's nothing to connect with them. I applaud what you're doing, but the incarnation of that idea is this doll. And I think it's it's tough. It's a tough tough business to be in. , yeah, I don't want to go back into it. I'm out. Let me tell you what I think. I did a deal with Robert that was a doll that had imperfections, cellulite, and one eye that's crooked and, , all these things normal people. What happened is that Barbie came out with the exact same thing. crushed us. , this is a completely different business. If you go to the toy store today in the robotic section, there is not one toy that's specifically aimed at girls. Such a smart idea, but I think that Damon's licensing offer is the smartest thing cuz he's expert at that. I have to be out. It's great when you're learning things and you don't know you're learning things. , you're playing. Yeah, exactly. Obviously, all of us would love our kids to to learn to code. I I love what you're doing. I think it's it's great. But I don't think I can add enough value to your business to invest. sadly, I'm out. . Retail is brutal. I everything about your company except the fact that you have a product that's in retail. You're still vulnerable to every new product that comes in trying to teach robotics slashprogramming slash whatever to girls. I'm out. Damon, you were 200,000 for 30%. Yeah. Is there any wiggle room in that? , the challenge is, let's talk industry standard. A normal licensing agent is normally around 25 to 35%. They don't pay you anything. They get it and go represent it. I'm paying you 200,000 to go out and license it. Make him a counter offer. Charie, what's your downside? Would you come back with 20%. You won't regret it. We will do a great job for you. I am dedicated to this. I'm planning on the licensing part. I'm going to have to stay at 30 25. We're meeting for $200,000. Yeah. Yeah. For us to go in licensing? Yes, it is. You got a deal. Yeah, thank you much. Congratulations. You sold it. done, kids. Congratulations. Byebye.

that fit we're forced to either buy custom clothes tailor everything we purchase or do something that boost the old self-esteem shop in the kids section to get the fit look at the shirts we're wearing today these shirts do not look good the sleeve and body lengths are too long the neck is too big and overall fit doesn't work awful these are these are normal clothes made for guys them not for guys us these are the only available options for shorter guys now let's try Ashen Anvil wow all now I know what you're thinking but no we're not models but our everyday shirt will sure make you feel one it fits much much better the lengths are correct and the shirt fits a shorter guy me sharks with your investment we can continue to go our sales the heights we can only dream of and Achieve our goal of keeping grown men everywhere from shopping in the kids section thanks guys we're all set watch your head on the way out R some shirts today if you'd to take a look all thank you Eric Robert here you go Lori thank you Ash an thank you shorter guy clo got it guys Is it wise to Brand it shorter guys clothes given the stigma you spoke about you tell us Kevin excuse me I'm of medium height we thought a ton about how do we brand this do we say vertically challenged do we say not tall what's the best way to do it and we ended up with shorter guy clothes cuz we were sick of trying to beat her on the bush why is it called Ash an anvil Ash comes from Detroit City's motto we will arise From the Ashes and Anvil is a tribute to the manufacturing Legacy of Detroit that's cool cool thanks Stephen I'm a tall guy's shorter guy's height when we did our studies and did a ton of fittings to get our style down guys that were 5'8 and Below fit better in our clothes than traditional ones what are you saying I'm short because how old are you I'm 5'6 myself 5 fo8 myself yeah our average customer is 5 fo5 let me see I'm 5'8 you're 5'8 you're not 5 look the heels look at the heels I'm 5 56 I don't know Dam get off your toes Dam you are not 5'8 my friend you are not I told people I was 5'7 for years I'm 5'8 I'm 5'8 you're 5'8 yeah Damon You' shrunk I'm 5'8 not anymore you're not what do you got in sales since launching 9 months ago over $130,000 of sales far after N9 months months that's not horrible that's on our website 100% And we sold out twice it's all online everything's online 100% tell us you sell those shirts for what are your margins all the business stuff yep our shirts retail for $79 and our margin now it's about 55% we first designed our fit we went on the streets and found hundreds of shorter guys and said hey come over to our apartment have a beer try on protyp go it worked it worked they came over they tried on prototypes looked at every little detail things the collar and the tail drop the cffs it's always smart to go ask people what are their thoughts to get feedback that's why social media is great today what do you guys need our biggest challenge now is inventory how do you acquire the database of 55 guys how do you find that customer it's an interesting challenge it's a subset of a subset subset Market because because I'm way out of your target market how big the Mark is the market is what he's trying to say if you look at it there's one and three American men are 5'8 and under which represents over 40 million adults in the us alone that's why I always felt that I was a little shorter than the average Siz person because Kevin's around my height Robert's around my height way taller you understand what I'm saying you're telling me I was walking around with this problem that I never realized I had and I think this is for a man who wears his shirt outside of his pants then of course it looks baggy I always wear my shirt inside on pants I think you're too -dressed for most of America if you look at clothes now you could buy a suit and short I know I wear a 40 short suit everything else is small medium large and it's made for a 6ot guy we're selling clothes that are more everyday and casual I think it's a clever idea I think you guys are for doing a good job thank you not my line of clothing it doesn't fit me I'm out thank you we have clothes that guys love we have 900 happy customers that want to buy more shirts it's about financing enough to meet that demand and preparing for new products and we haven't even talked about things jeans chinos shorts Master what you're doing first and you guys are smart you're doing everything but for me I don't think I'm the partner for you for that reason I'm going out thank you we've looked at Brands destination Xcel and Lane Bryant who led the way for plus-sized women's and big and tall men you have plus-sized women and petite women you have big and tall men and then there's nothing even though a third of us are short I'm puzzled on how to Market it accurately and I I think it's an emotional thing as I don't want to accept the fact that I need special clothes probably but you still need them this is not for me I'm out thank you Kevin and Mark what are you doing Mark we're sold out and guys continually come to us wanting to buy shirts and again the biggest challenge is inventory once we get more inventory and we know we can do it no guys I it I your focus on it I think there's a niche opportunity there I'll make you an offer 12 12% is not enough I'm going to have to get the 25% but I'll offer you $150,000 for the 25% that's my offer it's not a negotiation it's not a let me see what Kevin has to say it's a yes or no conversation we appreciate the offer would love to work with you we spent a lot of time getting to this point can we hear what Kevin has to say first nope wise man wow your call guys bird in the hand 100 50,000 25 I'll do the the 100K for 15% you [Music]

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a business that seeks to answer the age-old question, Whats in a name? [Music] Hi, Sharks. My name is Pamela Redmond and I'm here seeking $350,000 for 5% of my company. Sharks, we all have a name, but have you ever stopped to wonder about the impact of your name on you and your life? Kevin, let's take your name for instance. Kevin means handsome in the Irish language, but it can also mean kind, gentle, and beloved. All true. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Mr. Wonderful. Yes. And Mark, your name comes from Mars, the Roman god of war. Maybe that's where you get your competitive spirit. Lori, your name comes from the laurel tree, which is an ancient symbol of victory and honor. Maybe that's why you have such a drive to win and such a sweet way of celebrating when you do. Thank you, Kendra. Your name started out, as many female names do, as a form of a male name, Kenneth, but it's achieved complete independence, which is fitting for a solo entrepreneur who started a billion-dollar business. A Damon, your name is an old English surname that means keeper of livestock. Great she is. It's true. It's true. my god, how perfect is that for a keeper of bees? Sharks have always been fascinated by the power of names to shape our identities. That's why I started NameBerry, the world's largest website devoted to baby names. We have a 70,000 name database, thousands of lists, an active community, daily blog, and newsletter, and a revolutionary name generator called Baby Name DNA. As the premier experts in our field, we offer insights and advice to millions of name lovers and seekers every month. whether you're looking for original names, track celebrity trends, or even analyze your naming style based on your zodiac sign, we have you covered. sharks, who wants to help me reinvent baby names for the next generation? That's interesting. Thank you. That's a interesting valuation you've got there. , before you get to valuation, how do you source your data? , I have written 10 books about names starting in 1988, which is why I own all of my own IP. Wow. We've been around for 15 years. We have been profitable for 10 of those years. . , let's talk about how you make money. We make money from advertising at the moment, but you come in because we want to change that model. What's the model going to be? We want to bring AI to name. there's only two ways that can go. All this, , name generation, animology of names, the large language models are going to figure all those out across languages, ? And they'll feed and that's, , that already, ? And then the second side of it is you can sell all your information that you have to a particular large language model because they're competitive. My preference is to train our own model on our own data. We have millions of pages of information developed over 40 years. It's a singular property. then it's a question of how much are you willing to spend and it's not 300,000 or $500,000, ? To own your own model that you train yourself on unique data is is more expensive than that. Pamela, one of the big players has built a stack that you would sit on top of and they've done a lot of the hard work for you and they would take 20 30% of your revenue for providing the the infrastructure and the stack and maintain it for you. Kevin, when they do that, they're trying to steal from you, ? Of course. Of course. . And part and part of the reason I'm here is because I feel you can help us defend this singular piece of Is it defensible long term? My question then I think it is because it's internal data. It's data that only we have. . My two cents is companies will do their own where the money is for you is to license what you have to them and if you can prove to them that there's a lot of value that it'll generate a lot of responses to prompts then you can get a million5 million dollars. maybe you can help me do that. that that's a lot of work, ? And I'm not going to write you a check to do it. For those reasons, I'm out. . For me, I look at this and I think it's fascinating, but as far as a business, I feel this isn't something that I could sink my teeth into. I'm sorry. I'm I get it, Lori. I love you. And but I knew that. . , Pamela, let's go back to your business to understand why you valued it at 7 million. . , , now we're ad supported. We have 4 million unique visitors a month, 20 million page views. Last year we made 1.1 million. , and we net at 650,000. . That's not a bad living. Yeah, that's a good business. Yeah. When you look at the ads on your site, the banners that are appearing, they're around the genre of of child birth, ? Yes. . And that's generating 1.1 and it's pretty steady. Yes. , how many registered users do you have? We have a 100,000 people on our newsletter list. What's your open rate? about 50% depending on 50% on the 100,000 email. Kevin, that's better than anything you got. , yeah. By 20. I will say one thing about the data. It's hard today to capture the mother or father's name at time of birth. It's hard. You can't get it from the hospital. you there's all kinds of data scraping trying to figure out when they buy their first pampers and all this other stuff but you may be the cleanest truest source. Are you capturing all the people in any way either sell or email address? We are not doing that now. , now I have to kill you. Why aren't you doing that? It hasn't been our model. But that is something you could turn on now because that data is valuable to a giant infrastructure of companies that sell to to child birth. . I'm struggling with two things. I think that I'm struggling with how I could be a value cuz this is super tech. I'm struggling with that and how I can add value to that. And I the other thing I'm struggling with is why did my mother name me after a goat herder? , I'm out. Thank you. , what's the ownership cap table on your company? I own 66%. I have a tech partner who owns 28% and another partner who owns 5% who's non-participating partner. I I think this is cool, but this is a tech play, ? I'm not the one for you. And for that reason, I'm out. I don't think it's a tech deal. I think it's a giant negotiation between three behemoths that are developing language models. It's a interesting deal, Pamela. Here's an offer. 350,000, 33, and a third%. How about this as an offer? I will give you three times the equity, 15% for $700,000 money. Not a chance. I don't know how fast you get disrupted. That's the challenge. I would love to be in business with you, but I'm not going to give you 33%. , give me 40. The most I want to give is 24.9% because then I get to keep 50.1%. We'll do that, Kevin. Come on. , you've thought it through, Pamela. I've thought it through. All , I'll take that deal. I'll take the All . Yay. You want to do the deal? My god, I did not do that. Yes or no? Yes or no? Kevin, you got I think that's brilliant, Kevin. You're You're too interesting. Nice to meet you. That is good. Congrats, Pamela. That's awesome.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 350,000, billion-dollar, 300,000 or $500,000, My two cents, 700,000 (MONEY), Irish, Roman (NORP), Mars (LOC), English (LANGUAGE), Baby Name (PRODUCT), AI (ORG), second, first (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** your name, a lot, a business, a name, baby names, child birth, an offer, the age-old question\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 have: name\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 have: name database\n  \u2022 offer: insights\n  \u2022 analyze: naming style\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 source: data\n  \u2022 write: books\n  \u2022 make: money\n  \u2022 be: ways\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.28)\n\n**Topics:** datum, model, kevin, name, business",

We're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, this toilet stands before you today guilty of a terrible crime. Murder. That's . This porcelain perpetrator is the number one reason people lose phones to water damage. It doesn't stop there. Toilets, swimming pools, washing machines. Each year in the US, these kill 22 million phones with water damage. We've invented a machine that can bring phones, tablets, laptops, watches, anything that fits in the chamber back to life. It's not magic. It's science. Have a look inside our machine in real time. Transforming liquid into gas. Restoring your phone in 30 minutes. No need to disassemble or take anything apart. Sharks, this is my personal phone. It has no special protection, but I'm not worried. And I'm not worried. You murderer. , let's make a deal. Sharks. This is one opportunity you don't want to flush away. gosh. I'm going to take a moment to rescue this phone and then show you our process. This is a gut-wrenching moment for customers. Bring it in for service as quick as you can. Your device starts rusting as soon as it gets wet. , inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. , I feel it's a heart attack. You got to get CPR fast, ? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. ? , technically someone could ship it to you. , are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as as we have a mail-in service. But what are your sales? last year with a few stores we did $29,000 82 stores, ? We're talking about last year. Sorry, did you say that last year you sold the incredible amount of how much? $29,000 in sales with a few stores. We focused on making the economics on a per store basis profitable. . And then we launched to 82 stores and only two months later we've been asked to launch to 600 stores. What were your sales after the balance of the stores? this year we're on track with the expansion to hit $650,000. you go to a store and you say, Put this in for free or do they pay you? , you don't pay unless it works. They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? , in the in the beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? , on average, it works out to about $80 rent a month. Wait, $80 rent per month you're charging them. And then on top of that, we get a rev share, a percentage of the revenue. What's the percentage? On average, it's about 16%. , in order to do all this, you had to have raised a bunch of capital. We've raised 2.2 million far. Wow. Wow. And what was the value of the company post money? It had a valuation cap of 4.8 million. why is your valuation high? This is about getting to $800 per month per store. That's $6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in profit. But you're not doing that today. No. But if you discount that back from when we will be doing it, that's still far above $10 million. And what do you place as a value on that risk in case you don't execute? , honestly, I see you totally as an online business. You said you have three days, , in which it can still survive. We have an online market, but we haven't been able to afford national marketing for the online. I don't understand why you think you want to go retail. I don't see the big market. I'm out. Thank you. You came in asking for a $10 million valuation and I don't know how you're going to make that back that fast. And , unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. I think technology is your enemy. I was reading something the other day that the new Apple phone is almost totally water resistant. , I think the technology improvements can put you out of business by the time you figure out your model. Wouldn't put my money there amount. Guys, look, I the idea. I the concept, but you you're going to have to keep on raising capital. And unless I gave you that capital, I'm going to keep on getting diluted. The problem is how do I get my money back? , one of the reasons I think we're going to succeed is not because we may have a good plan. It's because we have an awesome team. Have you ever heard anybody start a company, hire their people, and say, We have a horrible team. That's not enough. I'm out. , everybody's out. Mr. Wonderful's left. I the story. I understand the model. I I don't want to argue about your valuation. I think it's too high. I'm going to loan you this 500k at 13%, but I'm taking the 5% as an equity warrant. That's the value I bring as a shark to this. , I want it paid back in 36 months. What do you think of this offer? Would you be willing to go more than 500,000 now? You asked for 500. That's the deal I would do. And I'm the only shark here today willing to give you an offer. , what do you want to do? All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We'll take that deal. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. That's terrific. Thank you much. Sounds Kevin. Let's see how your new investment works. Do it, Mark. That's great. , God. All , guys. Thanks. Do it. You got to have confidence. Do it. Kevin, if you believe in and the product, why not put it in the water?

We're here today seeking 500,000 for 3% equity in our company. Hello Sharks. We want to revolutionize health and it starts with bread. We teamed up with the best artisan bakers in the industry to bring you the healthiest, tastiest, most powerful bread in the game. And did we mention our bread, also known as the Uprising cube, is keto, paleo, and boosts gut health? That's . And it's dairy and gluten-free. Some say it even tastes it's straight out of heaven. We've truly done the impossible. Our cubes are packed with fiber and created with clean and boosted superfood ingredients. Now, who wants to join our health revolution and bring this mouthwatering taste heaven bread to the masses? Woo! Woo! Now, who wants to taste heaven? I want to show you up here. , what we have today is for you to experience live the uprising grilled cheese. We also have French toast. And this is a plain piece of the bread, ? Yes, exactly. I want to try that, too. Go ahead, jump in. , we didn't stop at bread. We also created chips. And yes, we have sales on both. We are brand builders through and through. I worked at Proctor and Gamble and Kristen works at another CPG company. It's important to us that we bring an aesthetic and an inspiration to our brand building efforts. It's got a little bit of a sponginess to it. Almost a cake. Chewy. It's chewy. What? And what is that? What's with that? , that is designed on purpose because we want you to have a specific mouth feel with this bread. This lasts one to four weeks in the fridge. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's amazing. And that's with no preservatives. I'm going to give you a little credit for the taste cuz I've tried a lot of these products and they taste utter The bread is good. This is pretty good. What does this cost? How much? That goes for $12 there. Wo. Wo. Yes. For a little loaf of bread that. Yes, there's a lot of power in that, guys. I think the bread tastes absolutely delicious, but I can't get over the price. 12 bucks for this tiny little half a loaf of bread. , how does that compare in the market? , I want to find a $5 bill in the bread. Do what ? I don't understand that. , this is not a basic bread. We're looking to upgrade bread. Americans are frankly getting sick because of the foods that were industrialized and scaled. My father is the type of person who represents the masses. Now he's an annuity for the medical system. He was given four weeks to live. We intervened with food and my dad is still here today. When we think about what we're doing here, it's not about us being successful. It's about the mission of helping people and we will drive success by solving this problem for society. I I agree with everything you're saying and I totally agree about the disease factor. My dad died from that. same issue. Irish guy, lots of starch, lots of white flour, killed him. But not everybody in America can afford for eight slices $12. That's expensive. Yeah, exactly. What are the revenues of this business? first year in business 2019, we did 85k topline. Second year in business 2020, the pandemic hits, we did under a million topline. How's that possible? What did you do? , hold on. It gets better. It gets better. First six months of 2021, 2.1 million year to date. Pretty good. I almost want to ask you for proof. We're experts at digital marketing. , now, we can deliver a consumer for under $50 customer acquisition cost. That is a lot for what you sell because you need a lifetime customer to overcome that initial. Yeah. Bingo. It would be a lot if we weren't in such a high frequency consumable. We got to get to grips with these numbers because the sales last year were impressive. But what's your profit? We are not cash flow positive yet. We have under a million in net losses in sorry for last year. Yes, we sell a one loaf for $12 that cost us $525 to make. But let's talk shipping. Once you take that down for shipping, we clear about a 30% margin once you average our bundle together. And you make about $3.60 per loaf. Yep. 500,000 for 3% imputes a $16.6 million valuation. Explain why you're worth $16.6 million. . We're on track to do 5 million this year. As you've heard, we've done 2.1 million year to date. Other companies us, we believe can get a 6x multiple in market. But you don't make money yet. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No, absolutely not. , when do you become profitable? Ever? , we we will become profitable when we reach a certain level of scale. No kidding. You will become profitable when you reach a certain level of scale. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. All sharks are still in, but they are concerned about the lack of profits for William and Kristen's healthy bread company, Uprising Food. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No. Absolutely not. when do you become profitable? Ever. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. What is your exit strategy? Yeah, we would to either exit the company to a larger multinational or we could foresee taking this company public at some point. I don't think I've ever sat and spent this time in my seat and heard more fancy words in my entire life. All . I think if I were to put any money into your business, I would not sleep a wink tonight. Wow. . It's not even a business that I'm listening to you about. It's a cause. The uprising, the battle has begun. But the bottom line here is I don't trust you to even protect my money. And sadly for me, that's the reason I'm out. Let me tell you a quick thing. Here's I want to share a few things with you. I the concept of healthier foods, ? And I do think that down the road it will have great potential because this is on trend for what people want. But sadly, it's also too big an ask for me, your valuation. , I'm sorry. I'm out. . Thank you, Laura. Thank you. I'm stuck as an investor on this 500,000 for 3%. For this deal to work, you're going to have to exit at close to half a billion valuation for me to get my money back. I'm out. . Thank you, guys. I think the product is great. , I consider myself a foodie and definitely a bread girl. And I thought this bread was , great. But equally, I think that the, , the sign of a good entrepreneur is to know the climate that you're in. And I think for, , many years now, those of us that are in direct to consumer businesses have been able to scale our businesses and do exactly what you guys said you were going to do, chase the top line without real consideration for becoming a profitable business. You guys did not come in and demonstrate what your path to profitability is. Great point. You missed it. You spoke about all of your order economics, which ain't that great, by the way, because you're paying too much to acquire the customer. And as everybody said, you're not profitable on your first customers. , I think for me, , I'm out. Thank you. Yeah. Guys, look, why don't you run the company to be profitable now? Why didn't you go after being profitable by the month to to be able to sustain all this? That's exactly what we did, Mark. We you lost a million dollars in the journey to get here. We aggressively drove CAC to the floor. We've been the number one lowest CAC in the field. That's such a nonsense parameter. You start small. You got a nice little product and whatever you do, you go door todoor. You go online. You sell it locally and you make money and you grow. But now your back is against the wall, ? Because you're losing money on every sale. the more customers you acquire, the more money you lose unless you can make sure that you're selling them a whole lot more products and your products are expensive and the bread on sliced you get it and it's what do I do now? , you don't take a bite out of it. That crust is important to preserving the product. People buy that product for the trifecta of three reasons. You can't find something this healthy that tastes this good that's this fresh. Then why don't you say that? Why don't you say that? That was the best thing you said all day. Exactly. That was the best sales pitch you've made. The the packaging that you're looking at there is unfortunately our Gen 2 packaging before we dialed in that positioning statement and figured out that was the winning combo. You're driving me nuts. , look. We are constantly I know. . . You're overselling with all the jargon when you have an authentically good product. . Your whole little speech on crust is everything you should be saying and selling this because of that. I want a product that's going to give me all these things that I can't get from a sliced product. That's all you had to say. simplify, focus on the product, and I'm out. Thank you guys. much. Good luck with the line. Thank you.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] [Music] Hi, my name is Megan Bowman. I'm from Ogden, Utah, and I'm the founder of a company called EcoFlower. I'm here today seeking $400,000 in exchange for 10% of my company. Let me share a little secret with you. Women are growing tired of the gift bouquet cycle. Get flowers, watch them die, procrastinate the trip to the garbage, and then wait for the day when somebody gives her another vase full of plant carcasses. There's a better way. Introducing EcoFlower. I found a floral solution that provides my customers with a beautiful bunch of flowers that not only last forever, but are also made with recycled and sustainable materials. We create with burlap, jute, twine, bamboo, book pages, beer bottles, wine bottles, lots of other materials that create timeless gifts, stunning bridal bouquets, and decoration for your home and businesses. Sharks together, we'll captivate the hearts of the women who will start to love getting flowers again. And I got each one of you gifts that I wanted to hand out before we start. , Robert, , thank you much. Wow, fancy. This is Croatia. This would be Croatia over here. And this is Kim's home country, Australia. And this is a heart. Yeah. Sniffle. Lori, I got you one of our buffets. This is beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. I was , he has the whole something wonderful platform and I wanted to show you what I can do with weddings. . And this is a bridal bouquet and that's a matching bineer. And all of your stuff is scented. yours is lemon. That's black raspberry. , that smells nice. Smell that. Barbara, I got you a spring bouquet. I love that for springtime. And then Damon, I got you lapels for your jacket. Cool. And Mr. Cubin, those are lapels. Yeah, this has $140 in it. And if I don't get a deal today, you got to give it back cuz I'm a little tight on cash. Thank you much. Look at that. That's made with real money. I'm spending this. Do you individually make these, Megan? I used to make them and it got out of my hands and now it's a good sign. Yeah, we have two manufacturers that make them for us. Megan, it's pretty. But let me ask this question to the ladies up here. Lori, Barbara, if a man sent you this instead of real flowers, how would you feel about that? my. [Music] You want an honest answer? Megan, I can ask you. It's a lack of sensitivity. It's a good point. I feel I should feel precious a flower. I would rather have a real flower. Lori would rather have real flowers. Barbara would rather have real flowers. What does that say? My customers have a completely different story. I don't know what women say when you're in a wealthy community, but in the community I come from, if a man buys you flowers, spends $50 on it, you're upset with him. a lot of women are upset. They're , that $50 should have gone to towards groceries or a lot of other things. When they can keep it forever, the women cherish it more. You can prove us wrong. Here's how you can here's how you can prove us wrong. What are your sales? Lifetime sales are 2.8 million. I've only been open for a year and a half. , good for you. That's awesome. It's all direct to consumer through our website. Nice. What do you sell your bundle for? , it's about $59 for a bridal bouquet. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How did it happen that you started this business? , I saw an episode of Shark Tank and I'm , I wish I had an idea. , I called my dad and he said, remember the wood flowers that you used to sell when you were in high school? this is an idea you could do for Shark Tank. And I tried out when I was only two weeks into business. Of course, I didn't make it far. But without Shark Tank, I wouldn't have thought awesome on my path. You have a lot of competition. I know. I Nobody's selling them in the masses by the bouquets. They're for crafting. People are getting them on Etsy six at a time to put them in little hair bows for their kids, but nobody has a bouquet that you can buy online for a gift. What I can tell you is they're not used heavily in the wedding industry because people want live flowers. The industry is set up because we pass a lot of contacts. It's more and take commissions off selling flowers. I started weddings 3 months ago. Yesterday we did $100,000 in sales and 25,000 of it was weddings. Wow. What caused that? , we have a big problem at my shop with production and we purposely hold our marketing department back. But yesterday I said throw $4,000 at the ad and I want to see what you were coming up here and you wanted to brag. . . , you spent you spent $4,000 yesterday. I love her. And what was a typical day prior to yesterday in sales? A typical day is anywhere from $6,000 to 13,000. . , you created another $90,000 in sales, ? You're killing it. How much your own money is in this? $700. my god. But I have a business partner who helped me. , I was living in a one-bedroom apartment about to be homeless and I was on the news because I was trying out for Shark Tank for my first time and they did a whole news story on it. This guy saw me on TV and he called me up and he said, I want to invest. What do you need? And I'm , I need my rent to be paid and I need groceries. How much did you sell to him and for how much? He only put in $3,000 up front for inventory and then he paid my rent every month for a year. Megan, how much 25%. , hang on. He got 25% for $3,000 and paying your rent for a year. Unbelievable. Have you taken on any other investors? I tried off Shark Tank, got denied and the business was booming at this point. I was I could not keep inventory in I needed another investment. we found a local investment firm that gave us $30,000 for how much? Two guys. they each took 25%. 50% that leaves 25. you own 25%. , in total, you sold 75% of your business for roughly $35,000. That was hard times. Yes. Wow. That was a year and a half ago. Megan, one of the reasons you started a business is to retain equity, ? And you want to see it grow and that's your payback. I give you 400,000. I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. My secretary is going to own more stock than you do. That's ridiculous. You're getting wiped out. [Music] All six sharks are still in. While everyone is impressed with Megan's big sales in her faux flower delivery business, EcoFlower, they are concerned that she already gave away 75% of her company to other investors only a year and a half into her business. I give you 400,000, I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. You're getting wiped out. You sold too much stock come from. It'll come from equal shares. We have a max that we're willing to go up to. , we can't , and my investors are tech guys. This is not their area. I want to get them out at some point. And , , later want to use my money to buy them out. I don't know, which would be smart. I feel you guys would have the contacts that could make that happen. I feel that equity could be used differently with people that know my industry better. , and they're open to it. , Megan, , you've heard the saying, it's better to own 10% of a billion dollar company than 100% of a That's why I'm here. , the the challenge is it's hard to build a billion dollar business. , when you're starting out in a small business, you should try to retain as much equity as you can for as long as you can, but you have 25% ownership. You don't control the business. You don't have the final say in the business. Who am I going to get into business with? They're wonderful people. They are. You got to hang on to the equity. , I'm out. , thank you, Megan. I spend more money on flowers than I'm embarrassed to admit than most people spend on groceries. I love flowers. I don't get these. I see these all over Manhattan in bathrooms usually. I don't even understand why people buy them, honestly. I don't get it. I have to love what I invest in. Great. , I am out. . Thank you. Look at you. , amazing. Amazing. You deserve much credit, but this is not me, ? This is not my area of expertise. I'm out. Thank you. I see these readily available out there everywhere. I don't think there's You're doing a great job yourself, ? There's not competition, though. But I don't have it. I'm first and best. I don't see it as the investment for me. , I'm sorry. Thank you. It makes it virtually impossible to invest in you without diluting you to a place where you are an employee. I'm still doing a great job. There's nobody doing what I'm doing. It's not investable for me. I'm out. I'm number one in this space. Come on, Damon. I'm going to do 4 million this year. Come on. I I have the same exact concerns that the other guys have that you started this whole business to not work for anybody now you're working for the company. have you talked to these tech investors and they have they confirmed that they are willing to sell their shares as ? They're willing to share at the price for sure. I need you to be vested in this business. I want to attempt to buy them out down the road and give you a bigger piece of this business. I'm going to offer you $400,000 for 25%. [Music] Wow. That wipes you out. You'll have no equity. No, that's not what I about it. Dilutes everybody about 6%. Did you do 20% that makes us all five equal? 555 is coming from all four partners to make me a fifth partner. Yes. [Music] You got a deal. . Thank you. my god. Thank you much. Thank you. You got to stay in the business, ? You promised me. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you got a deal, too. Made me 140 bucks. my gosh. I would have got that back.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Ogden, Utah, Croatia, Australia, Manhattan (GPE), EcoFlower, Shark Tank (ORG), Etsy (EVENT), first, fifth (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** shark tank, a lot, the business, a deal, real flowers, a year, this business, an employee\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 procrastinate: trip\n  \u2022 be: way\n  \u2022 introduce: EcoFlower\n  \u2022 find: solution\n  \u2022 create: gifts\n  \u2022 captivate: hearts\n  \u2022 get: one\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 get: one\n  \u2022 thank: you\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.21)\n\n**Topics:** business, flower, megan, bouquet, shark",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nHi Sharks. I'm Kelly and I'm Alana. We're here from Tampa, Florida and we're seeking $75,000 for 10% equity in our company. Picture this. You're engaged planning your dream wedding and you're excited. You've picked out the venue. You've set your guest list. And suddenly you realize one of the most important guests doesn't have a plus one. This guest of honor can't have anyone accompany them, though. They need someone who can transport them to and from the venue, pick up after them, and maybe even escort them down the aisle. , that's where we come in. I didn't expect that. Fairy tale Pet Care. That is a big dog. my gosh. Fairy tale pet Care. We're your dogs plus one. That's , Sharks. We're the crazy dog ladies that started the wedding pet care industry. Back in 2015, we noticed engaged couples were facing a major problem. Your pet is your family, too. , of course, you want them to be a part of your special day. But the logistics can quickly become overwhelming. That's why we take care of absolutely everything you don't have to. From roundtrip transportation to providing attire rentals to coordinating every last detail, we make sure that your wedding day can be your dog's best day ever, too. , Sharks, who's ready to join us in bringing the positivity to the wedding industry by investing in the nation's first wedding pet care company? , that's a brilliant idea. That's a great idea for you guys. It is. Thank you guys for joining us. Go enjoy a piece of wedding cake. We're going to talk business. A B. Now, I'm imagining you two are dog lovers, but tell us about you and how did you come to think of this? Alana and I have been best friends since we were 13 years old. , we grew up together. We're college roommates and after we graduated, we both ended up working for a national hotel chain and we spent a lot of time talking with each other about what path we wanted to take in life. Then a light bulb went off. We had friends and family getting married that were having this problem as as couples at the hotel and we realized that this could be an actual service that couples are looking for. How do you charge for it? Our prices start with a 3hour minimum, which is how much? , our pricing currently starts at ,600 and that's going to be for one dog for the three hours. , $600 and then $100 an hour for each additional hour. How does a customer find you? , we started in Tampa, Florida. , that's where we're from. We have our headquarter location there. And then we franchised about a year ago. And , we do Yes. Yes. , growth, our growth model was always that we knew this needed to be across the nation. . I want to be in the dog babysitting business for weddings. I call you up saying my region I'm in Houston. I want to franchise from you. Do I get a region? Yes. For one territory, it's a $12,500 franchise fee. , we're starting with low startup fees. We do plan on increasing those as we grow out our How much per wedding? How much do I pay you? Yeah. , it's 9% royalties of gross sales. Do you have any data on the success of a franchisee or your success? Yeah. , officially launched launched our franchise in 2022 and in our first year, we sold our first 14 territories. Wow. That is four locations. What is your sales your sales with your company for the last year? We did $123,000 in sales and what did you net? our margins are about 70%. 66,000 of the revenue there was in our Tampa territory which we consider a two territory market and then that extra revenue was in those fringe counties around us and we've been testing new markets. Do you provide the wedding leads that they get the jobs or they're on their own and they have to find themselves? We have a great social media following. we , as you can imagine, we blew up on TikTok because weddings plus dogs, it's content gold. we've been fortunate in in that aspect. Who's your oldest franchisee? our first franchisee is the in the marriage capital of the world, Las Vegas. that was a exciting first franchise to launch. our top performing franchisee is doing about $2,200 a month and they've been in business for 9 months. 2,200 a month. Yes. With that money, 2,200, you can't do it full time. What are your gross sales for all of your franchises, your own shop this past year? If we look at this past year, including our franchises, what is it combined? It's about $80,000 in the franchises and then 123,000 from Tampa. How did you get to franchise when your sales aren't even 250,000? , it's unique enough, ? And it's expensive to do the franchising as , , and we did invest. I love dogs. Loved having our dog at our wedding. It's small. I think it's a great business for you guys. I I don't see how it would get to critical mass. It It's not for me. I'm out. We understand. Thank you much. You guys listen, I I always think it's great when people are clever and creative. It's not a big enough thing for me. I to get involved in things that I think I can grow huge. And I wish you good luck, but unfortunately on this one, I'm out. Thank you much. And to touch on the the growth aspect with our franchise model, we are collecting those initial franchise fees. anywhere from 12,500 to 44,000 for you guys, ? But here's here's my challenge. , if a territory has 3,000 weddings in the year and you do a thousand of those weddings, that's $3 million a territory and you guys will make your 9%. , , that's $270,000 times, , 30 territories you may have. That's not a big enough number to to get me excited as an investment. And that's for perfection, ? That's if you get every wedding with that has, , a hamster associated with it. I I don't think the scale is enough for me to get excited. for those reasons, I'm out. But congratulations. I think it's a brilliant idea. I think it's great for you guys. We are ready now to scale. , we did take the first year in franchising. I do understand that now those sales are low. Yeah, you have two sharks left, ladies. And one of them is calls himself Mr. Wonderful Wedding. It's true. It's true. And I do want to mention that cuz we haven't brought it up yet that we are a missiondriven brand. a big part of what we do has been getting involved in our community and helping shelter animals cuz from day one we knew that was what we wanted this company to also be and we if this doesn't work out for you at the end of radio commercials when they tell you my talking too fast that's got to be you doing great I have six brothers and sisters you learn to be quick and loud I you you're able to articulate an extreme high velocity I but you haven't articulated something that in my mind is the most important thing in the franchise business. Absolutely. Choosing the people. Y I remember when I invested in Cousins Main Lobster, they only were making $60,000 in only one month until they went to a franchise model. However, I learned a lot. It was my first franchise. I learned that it was easy to get a franchise in. It was difficult to keep the franchise in. And that's why we only opened the four and took a minute to make sure that these four were stable, solid. Yeah. before we continue, which is the way to do. Of those franchises that apply, what percentage do you accept? , we've had about 100 organic inquiries come in specifically about our franchise business and we've only accepted the four far and we still have 20 in the pipeline that we're working with that we don't know yet if they're going to. , you're being selective. The only missing with this story is numbers aren't big enough because franchises have to make a living. It's a great business. It's a lifestyle business. If you love if you love animals, this is a way to get paid. This is the way to go. Plus, we have that mission aspect. what? I'd to make an offer. All . What I love about your business is it's at its inception, which I love. I the fact you tried five people before going gang busters. I invested in three different franchises, all who went bust because they brought in the wrong people, and they grew too fast, and I could not slow them down to qualify their people. , what I also about your business is I think there's a huge market for dog lovers who want to work part-time and make a part-time living as supplementary income. , I'll make you an offer of $75,000 for 25%. Wow. Thank you much for your offer. You're welcome to entertain his offer. Kevin, you have an idea. I have a I I love death and weddings. I invest in all of them. I love it. Here's my offer. I'm sorry. The way I'm looking at it, saying to myself, it's small now. . I could make hundreds of dollars. , it's I would do I would do I would do the 75 ,000, but I want to be the third partner. I want 33 and a third. And then I put the accelerator on it. Ladies, two interesting offers. Yes. What are you going to do? Thank you much, Mr. Wonderful, for your offer. , yeah.

Pasco, my company created Community Made. Community Made is transforming how we manufacture and sell clothing in the United States. We're mobilizing teams of seamstresses, tailor, patter makers from underserved communities to make sustainable clothes. One of the places where this is working today is G's Ben, a rural, small, remote community in Alabama. Black quilters are famous there. Now, Pasco Community made is there creating dignified jobs that pay a living wage. We're ready to scale the success we're having in G's Ben across America. Sharks, I'm asking you for $500,000 for 2.5% of my company Pasco. Together, we can do good and make money. I know you don't. You're a bit fashion. I have a long career. I've been in this for 35 years. Before I ran most recently, I've was at Georgia Armani. Then I did Perry Ellis, Paco Rabon, Anne Klein. I did a collection for Target that was great selling there. a pedigree. You've been around. , , I've been around and that's why I'm doing this. And Americans today don't have jobs. And G's Ben, where I showed you, work's not there. And we're putting it there. All these clothes are being made now in the US. , we're a six-year-old business now. 2019, pre-COVID, we did $6.7 million. Wow. , I picked this up and I thought, Ooh, these are cute. , these are my cup of tea. This is extremely nice fabric. What is a pair of pants these cost to make? $43 to make. 110 is the average cost of one of our products. The , you're not offering manufacturing facilities for anybody. It's for your own line of clothes, ? now. now, we are. , what we're doing is we're building pods across the Yes. We have one in New York City with the first one we started during the height of CO. We the one on G's Ben came online a month ago and now we're building more. What are your net profits? We're We're not profitable yet. . . But our average cart now is 209. Uhhuh. . To acquire that customer, it's costing us $95. That's a lot, ? Yeah, it is. But to today, we did $1.9 million. We're looking to finish this year at 4.5. The last be profitable on the $4.5 million in sales. And if not, what will your losses be? How big a hole are you digging? We are digging a few million dollars still. Patrick, tell me why. Now we're getting to it. . Because we're building the building out the rapidly scaling our pods out. we were getting close to we're getting close to profitability at that $7 million that we were in in 2019. Our revenue dropped in co and Patrick tell me this. I don't understand why your revenue dropped. . I run apparel companies. Co was a killer for anyone who's selling dresses, selling prints, selling sequins. I'm looking at essentially what looks elevated loungewear here, ? It's what everybody was wearing during co I know because at SKIMS we couldn't keep anything in that looked anything this. I don't understand why your sales decreased badly. We didn't have the supply. We hit a supply chain nightmare. What was your supply chain issue? We couldn't get the inventory we wanted. we didn't build community made until July of last year. . you buy our product. you have a pivot going on. when co hit, you pivoted into this new thing called community made. . Yes. What I'm trying to figure out is pre- pivot, how did you sell clothes to get to 6.7 million in sales? Because post pivot it seems to be a challenge. That's my whole thing, ? I think my big issue with what you're doing is that it hasn't caught light. I'm wondering what isn't hitting with the customers and that's what I'm struggling with. It's the convers it's the conversation, ? It's how how do you how do you build the conversation out of that traditional place of of buying your ads, ? , we're spending a great deal of money and that's why we're in a beautiful climate now, ? What social lets us storyt tell and the beauty of what you've created is you've got an incredible story. , either you don't know how to sell it and tell that story or the customer simply isn't there for it. Yeah, Emma's exactly . . Because with your story, if it resonates, your cost of customer acquisition with this shouldn't be 90, ? She can come out with a new product and bam, hit the story there. ? Then I go back to Good American. , when we launched that, we started talking about size inclusivity, diversity, the premium denim market. With a oneweek runup, we sold a million dollars of denim on day one. The customers will get it. And I think that there must be some huge disconnect in what you're doing. I can't stress this enough, ? We are at the beginning of this story. I But you're not, Patrick. That's my only problem. Let me ask you one question. You are a talented designer, but have you ever been a CEO of a manufacturing business? No. No. I can tell. I don't know where you are in the continuum of when your story gets traction or not. I'm a pragmatic investor. Yes, I to take half a million dollars on pour and pour it on a business model that's already proven. , I'm adding gasoline to the fire. I don't think your flame is lit yet. I don't. I'm out. Yeah. I I I disagree with you. Of course, I get it. I disagree with you. It's my 500,000. I'll cry if I want to. And and that's why I get to disagree with you. my business, , Patrick? , I have to say when you gave your presentation, you brought me almost to tears. I thought that story was riveting. I can't imagine it not resonating with everyone who hears it, but you can have my investment because of the lack of clarity. . , sadly, I must say for this reason, I'm not . I completely understand. I'm grateful for all of your time. , we're we're building something that isn't built out there. I'm, , I was a a fan of you. I remember reading about you in Vogue on the CFDA list. I I knew your face the minute you walked in here. I think you need to take that same obsession that you have with how you're making things and turn it into some obsession with your customers because your customer is speaking and I don't think you're listening. It isn't for me. I don't think it's an investable opportunity. , I'm out. But I applaud you. Thank you. As I'm sitting next to somebody who's built a fabulous clothing line and brand and more and more, , I have not built a clothing line. I wouldn't know how to help you. And regretfully, I'm out. Completely understand. Still one shark left. Mark Cuban. The problem is you haven't figured out how to sell it yet. And I think Emma brings up a great point, ? the way things were sold five years ago totally different than the way it was sold four years ago different than three than two now you have 15 seconds on TikTok if you're lucky you've got 30 and that's where most products are sold and that part you haven't figured out I'm not going to invest I'm going to go out because you have to figure that out and it's not easy to figure out but I wish you the best where we're going what we're going to build is going to be powerful we'll get it done we're going to get it done thank Yeah.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 2.5% (PERCENT), Americans, Good American (NORP), first (ORDINAL), 15 seconds (TIME)\n\n**Key Phrases:** g's ben, my company, the customers, the conversation, that story, your story, the way, a business\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 create: Community Made\n  \u2022 mobilize: teams\n  \u2022 create: jobs\n  \u2022 ask: you\n  \u2022 do: good\n  \u2022 have: career\n  \u2022 do: Perry Ellis\n  \u2022 do: collection\n  \u2022 have: jobs\n  \u2022 put: it\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.19)\n\n**Topics:** community, customer, story, year, business",

I'm Brandon Himmel from Leaport, Texas, and I'm seeking an investment of $200,000 for 5% ownership in my company, Roughlin Liners. Wow. millions of dog owners, I love taking my dog Satie with me whenever I go to the beach, hiking, or anything outdoors. But taking Satie with me on adventures would leave my truck with muddy seats, scratched door panels, and endless fur. There was no way to completely protect the backseat area from the mess Satie caused. That's why I invented Rough Liners. Down. Rufflin Liners protects my truck I don't need to worry about the mess Satie causes in the back seat area. The door-to-door protection makes it convenient to take your pet on more adventures and not stress about the mess. The cover velcros to plastic window inserts that easily slide into the window seal the door panels are completely protected. My patent pending design is engineered for the ultimate protection and it's made from heavy duty materials that it lasts. you don't need to worry about the mess your dog causes in the backseat area. With Roughliners, you're covered. Sharks, who's ready to join Roughliners and help pet owners take their best friend on more adventures? Brandon, how much do you sell it for? My prices range from about $99 to $150. I'm a premium product in this category. I try to provide a superior product, not only in the design, but in the materials that we choose. Brandon, you're saying there's competition then for this? There's nothing this extra large. Once my patent got published, I removed all there was 12 competitors and they all got removed. , there are seat liners, ? Yeah. There's a good amount of cheap Chinese manufacturers. , a couple of things that my seat covers have besides the door panel protection is I have e extra anchor points at the bottom that it keeps everything nice and snug and when your dog's in the back seat, it doesn't start to move out of place. I noticed that cuz I have the I've bought the the liners. You throw them in the back seat and they move. Yeah. Within 20 minutes they move and there's hair everywhere. Absolutely. Brenda, do you sell online? Most of my sales are online through Amazon. That's where I originally started. What are your sales? Tada. In 2022 is when I launched the brand of Roughliners. That was December of 2022. 2023 I did $1.25 million in sales. A million of that was in the last quarter. And Brandon, this year, what are you yearto date? This year I've done $3.1 million in sales. Great. Good for you. Thank you much. And what did you make on that? What on the 1.25 million? What did you make last year? About 40,000. Why low? , I've invested a lot into the long-term differentiator of the brand. , that's fine. , I've spent money on patents. , 3.1 million this year to date. How much do you think you'll do fourth quarter? I I'm expecting to do over $5 million. I think 5.5 is realistic. My goal was What are you going to make on it? 5.5. I should make over 500,000. far this year, I've made about 300,000. , what's your margin? My gross margin is around 73%. , you're spending a lot of money on advertising. I've been using some agencies that that I have do your marketing and stuff and they typically suck. My marketing I spend last month I spent a little bit over 100,000. Wow. , , it's probably going to be a lot cheaper to hire your own good SEO people. Yes. , that's the long-term goal is to bring this in house and congratulations, ? I'm not trying to take anything away from you. It's amazing. But we're trying to get a feel for where you're spending all your money, ? And typically the question would Kevin would ask is what's your rorowaz, ? What's your return on ad spend? And let's start with this customer acquisition cost for the new incremental customer. How much? my customer acquisition cost is around $20. My cost of goods is between 25 and $35. I have a question. We know nothing about you. Can you please tell us about you? I've always been an entrepreneur. When I was 5 years old, I was shining shoes at my grandpa's barber shop because I didn't get allowance. I had to go out and make money and find ways to go do things with friends. Soon as I got out of high school, I was in the Marine Corps. Spent 5 years in the Marine Corp. Thank you much. I appreciate that. Then after that, I went to college. I got my degree in physics. Nine years I was an engineer. And then last year I quit my job last July and now I do rough liners all the time. Good for you. What a great story. All , I've heard enough. I'm going to make you an offer. I've have gone on search for liners. There are thousands of them. There's nothing that proprietary about what you're doing other than your story is fantastic. Your customer acquisition cost is too high, but I'm going to make you an offer anyways. I'll give you the 200,000 for 20%. , Brandon, quick question for you. How much money did you put into it? , in in 2019, both my parents passed away within an 8week period. And it made me realize that life is short. And I didn't get a whole lot from them, but I got a little I got enough money to put $15,000 into taking my idea and making a product. Good for you. My god. And that was where the initial money came from and got me the beta version of the product I can start testing it and getting some customer feedback. And I want to do something with this money that makes me remember my parents. What you've done is phenomenal. You're a beast and it, ? You outwork everybody. And that's what great entrepreneurs do. Amazing. Now the bad news. The bad news from my perspective is you're spending 27% of your gross dollars at Amazon. Absolutely. And to me, as I look at businesses that sell online, that's scary. Yep. That's the fear for me because you can't control your own destiny now. , for those reasons, I'm out. You make me think of my Drop Stop guys. They've been doing phenomenal. I think we're 50 million in sales. They started to get all these knockoffs and recently it's become challenging. When I think about investing in something this, I'm concerned it's going to be a bit of a rough road. And , for those reasons, I'm sorry. I'm out. I'll make you an offer. [Music] You're lacking two things from what I'm seeing. Cash. You're going to need at least a million dollar credit line, which I would provide for you. And the other thing you're desperately lacking is you're not doing anything on social. But I can help you with the social and I sure can help you with the cash. , my offer is $200,000 or 20%. And I'll give you a million dollar credit line. 20% is a little bit higher that than I want to go on my baby that I love and I've put in much work. However, I think my margins could be exponentially better with the help of a shark. I would to bring that number down closer to 10%. I I think 10% I'm going to do over 5 million this year in revenue. What is that? 20some%. Brandon, there might be another offer. Two sharks are out. Brandon has two offers on the table for his interior vehicle cover business, Roughliners. But Robert may also be interested. Brandon, there might be another offer. Mark gave you the bad news. There's going to be a lot of challenges. But here's the good news. You're on Shark Tank. Y you keep going on Amazon you're doing. You start building the other socials Barbara is saying, and we can help you with that. , I love dogs. I I took a product here, Pup Box, and we sold it within 18 months for $12 million to PetSmart. I will give you 200,000 for greedy, greedy, greedy 15%. I I the number at 10%. I the number at 15%. I'm going to do over 5.5 million. I do have utility patents. 200,000 for 14%. Could we do a royalty deal to bring you to get your money back and bring you down to 10%. A dollar a unit. I'm going to do 50,000 units in the next 12 months or more. If I didn't grow at all. I'm going to do 50,000 units. 200,000 10% $5 royalty per unit. Oo, that's that's hard on the capital side because if I if I pay you back, I think it would happen in three years going off my 200,000 10% $3 royalty per unit. A dollar a unit. $2. I'll do that deal at a dollar unit. 10 come down to 10%. Yeah, to squeeze his head. Would you mind going in together? Dogs hate him. Brandon, I'll do the deal for a buck till I get my money back for 10%. to squeeze his head. I will do the same deal. Would you mind going in together? And this I don't get out of bed for 5%. I don't even bother. I I'll forget who you are for 5%. Brandon, I will only do this deal because I believe much in you. Seriously, Robert, let's do a deal. Yeah. Do I get to keep the dog?

cities out of mud in my backyard and I used to raid dumpsters for parts to see what type of crazy things I could build kids have always had a ton of potential and a huge appetite to create but often lack the opportunity to build their Vision we've come up with more powerful way for kids to build and design toys the way they want it introducing Toy Box the first of its kind 3D printer and creativity platform built entirely with kids in mind and with the toy box app you can immediately start printing with absolutely no prior training how's it work simply find the toy you want and press print Toy Box will instantly beam down your toy and start printing and if you're feeling more creative you're in luck welcome to the Creator space of the app here kids can design and print their own toys whether you're drawing simple things or designing your own Block Buddies toy box can fuel your creative needs sharks let's invest in the next generation of young minds and turn this toy box into a money box and of course we have samples cool how you cute I got a lobster why a lobster for Damon cuz I used to work a Red lobstered Lobster that's and Lori we printed you your own Scrub Daddy and Mr Wonderful we printed you your one one true love a big bag of money Jamie we printed you a shout out to your shark take pitch a cutout of Kevin o and Mark we know you're super involved in basketball we gave me a pumpkin a big orange are you going to give me a license deal I'm offering you $600,000 anyways guys tell us about your business we built most of this company on an $80,000 investment total we've rais raised around $290,000 the reason we were able to build this product with such a small investment was because we're experts in software we've worked at Microsoft as developers and Engineers I personally worked in data science this isn't unique and that 3D printers have been out now for a while what's different is is that yours is specifically for toys and is it therefore smaller and less expensive than others out there yeah we sell this printer for $99 which is definitely on the cheapest end of 3D printers what we do specially for kids is we combine hardware and software to make a friendly user experience we have now over 750 toys we add 7 to 10 toys a week and then we're always monitoring what kids are playing with and we adjust what we add based off of that you the worry with toys is that it gets used a couple times and then put away and at 299 that's that's a big decision on a toy what are your sales now we're focusing on internet sales primarily sales on our website we started selling in September we've done over $300,000 in sales since then and all we do is advertise on Facebook and what does it cost you to make we buy this for $150 we sell it for $2.99 but there's nobody on the market that has this software and Hardware stack that's developed for children our biggest Target demographic is 6 to 9 year olds and you can print toys from from famous media Disney Minecraft Marvel Lego also of things youd have to go license those that's licensing is a huge opportunity imagine if a kid could print his own Minecraft world on this printer we see this as a huge huge huge opportunity how long did it take to print this out and how many passes that one takes about 4 hours maybe about eight passes you see there's the problem the attention span of a 6 Seven 8 or 9y- old is going to be difficult and I can see the first couple times mom or dad or whoever helping them and that's great but no kid that age has that attention span and I think that's too big a challenge for those Reasons I'm Alis guys liability wise you're dealing with seven-year-olds when I was seven I would have easily held my my parrot under there to make some boots for the parrot I'm a little afraid of selling to a bunch of six seven and 8y olds where what can happen will go wrong we do require Parental Guidance and you can say that all you want but no parents sitting there for 4 hours with them and that machine's running and I'm is a little concerned about that for that reason I'm out thank you guys you're a subset of the toy business you have to find that parent that's thinking investing $300 in my child's imagination is a good thing and I think that's cool but it's not everybody I it though I'm going to make you an offer I bring a lot of value to this space that's the way I look at it but now you're still at the proof of concept you're starting out and I happen to think licensing would help this and that's hard work I agree I'll give you the 150,000 for 10% and the reason I'm saying that is that certain things you want to do will happen faster with me driving them let me make it easier for you I love the mission I love I have a 9-year-old son I would love the idea that he'd play with this I think at 299 I don't see it yet hope you succeed with it though I I ruin it for you guys but I'm out as a investor I think that Jen and Ben I want you to know something if she drops out that gives me a lot more incentive to get friskier that because you're starting to lose sharks here and I made you an offer I I would I would love to hear your offer Lori before I was rudely inter pointing out a reality of the Shark Tank that's all I was saying I think products this are great because they Inspire kids to build and design and develop the problem I have is is I think that the age group you're targeting is a little bit too young if it was the next age bracket up 8 to 13 I would would it better as an investment for me but because it's not I'm out than she didn't have an offer but you still have an offer but it's going to be modified slightly I'm feeling frisky now I don't it when I make an offer and you're still listening to others you have to realize I have flexibility too I want 15% not 10 as usual all Road lead to Mr Wonderful what are you going to do do you mind if we talk about this for a little bit sure but what happens you don't want to leave the carpet all we'll do $150,000 for 12% that's our final deal you think the difference you think the difference of 3% R basis points makes a difference I you either believe that 15% is worth it or not I bring a lot to the table no 85% of a watermelon is a whole lot better than 100% of a grape all we'll do 13% and then two no no I'm not done and and 2% in advisory share 13% and say it again 2% in our advisory shares from our pool [Music] you have a deal all congratulations my goodness that was tough that's good you did a good job congratulations guys you did it

We're from New Jersey and we're seeking $343,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Let's face it, cleaning your shower is about as much fun as getting a root canal. It's no wonder my son Jake here survived four full years of college without ever cleaning his shower once. Mom, he even had a stinky pet that he never bathed. Using a bucket to bathe Joey was setting off a water bomb in the bathroom. There's got to be a better way. The struggle is real, but have no fear. Rinseroo has come to the rescue. Rinseroos are slip-on hoses that make your least favorite rinsing and bathing chores a breeze. No more buckets. No more backachches, sharks. You're about to witness rinsing reinvented. You whip out your rinseroo. Slip it over any water source and bam, you're ready to conquer any rinsing challenge that comes your way. And the best news, rinseroos work on water sources all around your house. Sinks, showerheads, and tub faucets. This one even has a spray head. make sure your connection is tight and get rinserooing. Mom. Mom. There are many things you can do with a rinseroo. Rinse dirty boots. Bathe the baby. Not the ba. Not the baby. From the sink. But wait, there's more. Use it as a bedet. Don't forget to give grandpa his sponge bath. Which one of you sharks hates cleaning as much as we do and wants to clean up with us at the bank instead with Rineroo? Tell me how you came up with this idea. , here's the thing. how they say sometimes your best ideas happen in the shower? That's where this idea came to me. , we have a beach house at the Jersey Shore and when we're all there, there's 15 of us and four dogs. I wanted to be up on the beach, but instead I found myself in the shower cleaning dogs, cleaning the shower walls. I was filling a bucket over and over. I'm , there's got to be a better way. , I recruited Jake. Yep. And together we came up with amazing prototype and it worked. Lori, guess what we did? We bought your book that told us how to figure out if we have a hero or a zero. . And honestly, we're reading the book. I'm , my god, we have a hero. We have a hero. It's mass market. It's demonstrable. And it solves many problems. your stuff. I love it. It It is, Lori. And I have to say I'm grateful because your advice has changed our lives for the better. Now Lisa, here's the moment of truth because in Lor's book it says I sit beside Mr. Wonderful and always ask this nasty question about valuation. You're putting this business out at $6.8 million. Why is Rinseroo worth anywhere near $6 million? what, Mr. Wonderful? I know that's page three in Lor's book. Exactly. I crunched the numbers and three points. Let's hear the numbers. , let's hear the numbers. now here's the thing. We started in March of 2019. Yeah. And instantly, Rinseroo was a success. Within a couple months, we were profitable. We did over a million dollars in sales. Our first year, since then, I might have to get Lor's book. That's . We've had double and tripledigit sales. What are you going to make this year? What are you going to make? close to $5 million. Where are you selling this? , now we're only selling online. We're 99% online. That's why you need to shop. Wow, that's amazing. What do you sell them for and what's it cost you to make? Our landed cost, depending on what product you have, is anywhere from $2.50 to $4.50. And our retail prices are anywhere from $15.95 to $29.95. , about an 85% profit margin. You guys got to be the two of you. the two of you running the business. love this mother son thing much. Honestly, what a dream. . guys, you must know what it cost to acquire a customer, ? The customer acquisition cost. I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wonderful. Yes. $2.50. And what is your rorowass if you're spending money on . We have a 10 to1 return on our ad spend on Amazon. What percentage of your revenues do you spend on Amazon? 10%. what are you making in net cash profits? Almost a million dollars. . That doesn't suck. How many knockoffs do you have now? We have many knockoffs, but we have a protection service that takes them all down. , we have many. Is there a patent? Yes. All . , listen. I'll give you 343 for 20%. 20%. I was going to do that same deal for 15. I'd offer you 15.

We've done all the hard work. All . 15%. You have two offers of 15. Unless you want to put a royalty in place, take less equity. What would you What would you suggest? You have you have enough margin. I I think what I would do is I'd do your 5% deal if I got 250 a unit until I made back a million bucks. Then the royalty goes away forever. Oo. , that that's a little hefty. I think still I don't know. , I don't do this often. As a matter of fact, I didn't do it at all last year. Hello to my little golden friend. I was hoping we would get the gold ticket. my goodness. You won the ticket. I think you deserve my golden ticket. Thank you much. I do. Wow. You read my book. We did. From cover to cover.

Not if we have anything to say about it. Hey Sharks, my name is Glenn Smith and I'm his daughter and business partner, Madison Smith. And today we are here seeking $90,000 for 15% equity in our company. Sharks, for generations, cooks around the world have sought relief from the infamous onion tears. The burning, the itching, my eyes. Cutting onions is painful. And we have tried all the hacks and none of them have worked for us. We have tried chewing on bread while cutting. We've put a matchick between our teeth. And this guy has even worn yard goggles in the kitchen. And trust us Sharks, none of these hacks have worked for us, which is why we invented the Fion. The Fion is a countertop cute cordless fan that is placed next to your cutting board, which simply blows away the fumes and vapors of eye irritating vegetables such as onions, shallots, peppers, garlic, etc. You'll only cry tears of joy. It is that simple. , come on sharks. Who's ready to chop it up with the fanion? And who's ready to be blown away? Now, sharks, no need to get weepy. You each have a fanion to blow those tears away. , you have an onion, a knife, and a fan to put this to the test. , there's a lever on the back that'll turn it on, and you can get to chopping. And Madison, do most people cry with onions? Yes, we've Yeah. , why would you not? I don't often cry. I don't this doesn't sting me at all. ? I am told that if you wear contacts that can be something that would wear if you wear contacts. If you wear contacts, you're lucky. , a unique attribute about vampires. I'm a vampire. We We don't have to cry about onions. We can cut any vegetable. No problem at all. As long as it's dark outside. Is this your full-time jobs? And And also, please tell us about you. You go ahead. I I am a vice president of a large US poultry company. I buy feed ingredients, feed chickens. And Madison, what do you do? After graduating from Georgia Tech, I studied industrial engineering and I've worked in the technology and supply chain spaces for about the last four years. , this simple product, I get it. How much to buy it? We sell them for $19.99 on our website. And what does it cost you to make them? 809. , your numbers. How many do you sell? We launched in November and about seven months. We have sold almost 1,800. We have 28,000 in sales. That's not bad. Not bad at all. How are you guys promoting it? We've predominantly done social media. We've put a lot of money into running ads. And how much money have you spent on advertising far? On advertising about $178,000. And how much money have you invested to get it to this? $468,000. Hello. That's a lot of crying over on you. Where did you get the money to spend 468,000? Cash, credit, home equity. Home equity, too. Home equity as . Correct. Wa. But what did you spend that on for this? , mostly inventory. How much do you have in inventory? At your cost. How much do you have in inventory at your cost? 31,000 units. . , that's 240 250 grand . Correct. You got 31,000 units. What is it costing you to acquire a customer now? Do how much did you spend on advertising divided by the number of units you've sold? 17,000 divided by almost 1,800. Yeah. . about 10 bucks a unit. Yeah. you're breaking even you're not making any money now. You're you're losing some. Yes. What's the plan to sell the existing sunk inventory? That is why we are here is that we need help with that where we started trying to go 100% direct to consumer. Over 10,000 Google searches happen every month of people searching how to stop crying while cutting onions. there's viral Tik Tok videos. This is definitely and it works. We know that it works and there's not a product out there it. And everybody loves a kitchen gadget. maybe there's a reason why there's not a product out there it. Look guys, I give you a lot of credit for diving in and going for it. But this is too niche a market, ? Because when you limit it to onions, that's too small, ? And not a lot of people are going to spend $19.95 to be able to do onions alone. for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Bart. Here's the thing. It's something that happens all the time. I watch it with entrepreneurs. You get excited that you don't realize one of the most perilous pitfalls when you first create a product is ordering in too much inventory without sales. You've sold 1,800 in 8 months, give or take. You've sitting on 31,000. This could take you 10 years or more, , to sell it. , what I think you should do, a suggestion is sell it to someone at your cost to break even, but to get money back because you don't want to sit on that big of an expense. It's not a journey that I want to take cuz I know it's a rough road. , but I wish you good luck. I hope you try that. I'm sorry. carry them out. You got a bunch of money tied up in inventory here, 250 grand. , if you sold these things at $9.99, you'd get half your money back. And you say the other was a lesson in life. 31,000 units. that's worth crying about, not the onion. I can't help you because I can't help you. I'm out. All my friends have never started a business. They think the starting a business is standing on the edge of a cliff, ordering 30,000 units, and jumping into the water. Great entrepreneurs learn about controlled risk. You never want to make a mistake that's going to kill you. It's hard to come back from the dead. Kevin's done it, but way it works. You made a big risk and now you're stuck with it. But you got to get rid of that inventory. There is no we're going to grow our market. We're going to sell it here. Get rid of the inventory that you have even at a loss. Even if you get 50 cents on the dollar. I disagree. They're being melodramatic. No, they got rid of dramatic. They took a line of credit on their house to get here. Welcome to the Onion Advice Bank. It's not for me cuz it's not investable. I hope you get some of that cash back. I'm out. Glenn and Madison, I love the fact that you're working together. My daughter's here watching Shark Tank today and it's such a special thing. It's the most important thing in the world because my dad is no longer here with me and I wish he was around and I miss him and I love the fact that you guys can have this journey together. I wish you the best of luck but I'm out. Thank you much much meeting you all. Good luck guys. I hope you make it. Good luck.

Yes. , happy to talk about the business model quick. , , we have a printer and ink cartridge business model. . , we sell the grow chamber for $3.99 and then on the back end we have a subscription where we sell these ready torow mushroom cakes for 30 bucks a piece. How much does this cost you to make? $158. $158. That's . And then what does a shroom block cost? 351. This is where we make a lot of cash. How long does it take for a grow block to become that a fruing bite? It depends on what you're growing. Some varieties such as oysters can grow in as little as seven days. Some reishi can take longer up to 6 weeks. a lot of people they love them because they view it as a functional art piece. with the mood lighting, the embedded time-lapse camera. This is something that they show off to their friends on social media and it's it's a brag point. You're a mushroomologist. Micologist. Yes. A micologist. Yes. You're a pretty bright guy. You can tell. Where did this come from? Yeah. , it started about seven years ago. I was in college. I was growing mushrooms in my dorm. Of course you were. Of course I was. , and it it was something that I had a natural interest in and I decided I want to get into product building. , I bought some 3D printers, figured out CAD modeling, basic micro electronics, and it started off as a weekend hackathon project and there was a lot of interest. And , , where we're at now is we have 6,500 paid customers, 22 6,500. Yes. and 22,500 people on the email wait list. I got back from Shanghai last week. We're rolling out mass production. 22,000 back orders. 22,000 people on the email wait list. Weight list. What does that mean? What does that mean? They they signed up to get a small discount. Can you walk us through your sales history? Yeah, Terishroom started back in August 2022. I started running ads on Facebook and since then we've generated $780,000 in revenue total. Total. Yeah, but keep in mind we haven't shipped out yet. Yeah. And we , wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You haven't shipped any yet? I got back from Shanghai. , because you said you sold 6,500 units, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. , you didn't say that. , I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. You've taken 78,000 of pre-orders in two years and not shipped the single product. , I think I should I should keep selling it without shipping stuff. That's not horrible if they deliver. It's only horrible if they don't deliver. It's been two years, Mark. No, they haven't collect the money for 2 years. Yeah, he has. No, no. Here, let me clarify this. , we started Facebook ads in Q4 2022. We shut them off because what happened was I had a a prototype. I was told by a product development company that was , yeah, we can get this done in a couple months. , I was , sweet, we're almost there. I realized that was not the truth. , it was back to the draw. Can't even make a mold in a couple of months. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. what happened is I was I need to build a team that is on the cap table and we are all in this and not someone who's going to charge a per hour or a consultancy fee. But that was 2 years ago. Why haven't you shipped 50 of them or some element of , frankly we've we've overengineered this. We we didn't want to ship out hundreds and get a refund problem. When are you going to ship your first,000 units and have them in the market? , we're gonna have 1,140 units shipped to our Austin warehouse by July. Jared, but I think it's cool, ? And if it turns out to work, it could be nice, but you oversell. You're not there and ready to deliver yet. And that's a whole different level of uncertainty and and terror. I can see it being great for you, I'm excited for you. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Jared. But I think it's beautiful. I think it's exciting. But I think your valuation is way way way off. And for that reason, I'm out. You're s Thank you. Wish you the best. It's a beautifully designed product. You're a highly credible guy. But we had to ask you if you've shipped any. You didn't tell us that. It always makes me nervous when I have to find out such a crucial fact and pull it out. I can't get there. I'm out. Thank you. I love hydroponic farming. I think it's cool. , there's no pesticides. Exactly. It's safer. But this seems to me overengineered. If it was simply something where you watered it, it could grow. It's got the light without the camera, without the app, it would be a much simpler contraption. , I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Thank you, Lord. , all fun lead back to Mr. Wonderful. I the idea. I I'm willing to take a flyer on it, but not at your valuation. I'll give you the 175. I go on the ride for 15%. Are you ready? honestly, I don't think you're ready to take on an investor. , he can make a decision. Are you going to walk out of here without a deal or I become an investor and I put my team on it and we get you more orders than you've ever dreamt of? Why do you think 15%. It's my intuition after doing deals for decades. if this works, we're gonna have to raise a lot more money for inventory alone, ? And I'm willing to take that risk, but it's embedded in the valuation. Kevin, , respectfully, we we raised a lot more money at a much higher valuation. , I I totally respect that, but they are not me. I don't think you're ready to put the product out on the market, even if you're about to. He has no choice but to put it on the market. No, he does have a choice cuz he has a brand that he doesn't want to destroy. He doesn't have a brand yet. He hasn't shipped the unit yet. He's got,40 coming that he's already spent the money on here that a person can do ever in life. We got it. No, you don't got it because you're going to invest in it and you don't I'm willing to take that chance. I already talked about it. I'm going to be honest with you. The biggest problem that a person making a product can do is putting it out on the market when it is not . That is true. It can destroy you, your credibility, all the people that were behind you. And Jared, I'm willing to take that chance and then get back. Lori, Lori, we got it. I'm willing to take that chance and invest in you. 175,000 for 15%. I'll do that deal. I have no flexibility. What do you want to do? That is a that is a number that it's absolutely not going to work. Kevin, I could do 5%. And let me tell you why. Because you don't have to go any further. I'm out. Thank you, Jared. Thank you'all. Good luck, Jared.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi, Sharks. I'm Lisa. And I'm Jake. We're from New Jersey and we're seeking $343,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Let's face it, cleaning your shower is about as much fun as getting a root canal. It's no wonder my son Jake here survived four full years of college without ever cleaning his shower once. Mom. He even had a stinky pet that he never bathed. Using a bucket to bathe Joey was setting off a water bomb in the bathroom. There's got to be a better way. The struggle is real, but have no fear. Rinseroo has come to the rescue. Rinseroos are slip-on hoses that make your least favorite rinsing and bathing chores a breeze. No more buckets. No more backachches. Sharks, you're about to witness rinsing reinvented. You whip out your rinseroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, slip it over any water source, and bam, you're ready to conquer any rinsing challenge that comes your way. And the best news, rinseroos work on water sources all around your house, sinks, shower heads, and tub faucets. This one even has a spray head. make sure your connection is tight and get rinserooing. Mom, mom, there are many things you can do with a rinseroo. Rinse dirty boots. Bathe the baby. Not the baby. Not it from the sink. But wait, there's more. Use it as a bet. Don't forget to give grandpa his sponge bath. Which one of you sharks hates cleaning as much as we do and wants to clean up with us at the bank instead with Rineroo? Tell me how you came up with this idea. , here's the thing. how they say sometimes your best ideas happen in the shower? That's where this idea came to me. , we have a beach house at the Jersey Shore, and when we're all there, there's 15 of us and four dogs. I wanted to be up on the beach, but instead, I found myself in the shower cleaning dogs, cleaning the shower walls. I was filling a bucket over and over. I'm , there's got to be a better way. , I recruited Jake. Yep. And together, we came up with amazing prototype, and it , worked. , Lori, guess what we did? We bought your book that told us how to figure out if we have a hero or a zero, ? Yeah. And honestly, we're reading the book. I'm , my god, we have a hero. We have a hero. It's mass market. It's demonstrable and it's solved many problems. , your stuff. I love it. It is, Lori. And I have to say, I'm grateful because your advice has changed our lives for the better. Now, Lisa, here's the moment of truth. Because in Lor's book it says I sit beside Mr. Wonderful and always asks this nasty question about valuation. You're putting this business out at $6.8 million. Absolutely. Why is Rinseroo worth anywhere near $6 million? what, Mr. Wonderful? I know that's page three in Lor's book. Exactly. I crunched the numbers and let's hear the numbers. Let's hear the numbers. now here's the thing. We started in March of 2019. Yeah. And instantly Rinseroo was a success. Within a couple months, we were profitable. We did over a million dollars in sales our first year. Since then, I might have to get Lor's book. That's . We've had double and tripledigit sales. What are you going to make this year? What are you going to make? Close to $5 million. Where are you selling this? , now we're only selling online. We're 99% online. That's why you need a shark. That's amazing. What do you sell them for and what does it cost you to make? Our landed cost, depending on what product you have, is anywhere from $2.50 to $4.50. And our retail prices are anywhere from $15.95 to $29.95. , we've got an 85% profit margin. You guys got to be the two of you. the two of you running the business. I love this mother son thing much. I honestly what a dream. . , guys, you must know what it cost to acquire a customer, ? The customer acquisition cost. I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wonderful. Yes. $2.50. And what is your rorowass if you're spending money on? . We have a 10 to one return on our ad spend on Amazon. What percentage of your revenues do you spend on Amazon? 10%. , what are you making in net cash profits? Almost a million dollars. That doesn't suck. How many knockoffs do you have now? We have many knockoffs, but we have a protection service that takes them all down. , we have many knockoffs. Wait, is there a patent? Yes. All . , listen. I'll give you 3.43 for 20%. 20%. I was going to do that same deal for 15. I'd offer you 15. Here's the thing. , I I I don't want to give away a ton of equity, but I would love to work with a shark that can help us grow. , this is for my son, and I I don't I don't want to give away a lot of equity. We've done all the hard work. All . 15%. You have two offers of 15. Unless you want to put a royalty in place, take less equity. What would you What would you suggest? You have you have enough margin. I I think what I would do is I'd do your 5% deal if I got 250 a unit until I made back a million bucks and the royalty goes away forever. , that that's a little hefty, I think. Still, I don't know. , I don't do this often. As a matter of fact, I didn't do it at all at all last year. Not to my little golden friend. I was hoping we would get the gold ticket. my goodness. I think you deserve my golden ticket. Thank you much. I do. Wow. You read my book. We did. From cover to cover. You followed it. You did what it said. It helped you. You are my perfect entrepreneurs. You are successful. [Music] What that means is that I'm giving you exactly what you're asking. Thank you much. Wow. my god. Yeah. Welcome to the Rinser family. Necklace. The golden ticket. , last year nobody got a golden ticket. That's incredible. I hate to admit it, but you were our girl from day one. Thank you much. You are You are our dream shark. Congratulations. I love you guys. I love you guys. Congratulations. my god, Jake. I'm excited. It's an inventor's dream to have gotten the golden ticket from Lorie. Our goal was to team up with her to get Rinse Room in every household in America.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] First into the tank are entrepreneurs who believe they have an important postworkout tool. Hi Sharks. My name is Anthony Jensenstead and I'm Lauren Campbell. We're seeking $500,000 for 2 and a.5% of our company Firefly Recovery. Sharks, did many athletes today recovery has become as important as working out? Athletes are talking about their recovery. They're tracking their recovery. They're even posting about it on social media. But recovery modalities have not kept up with the times. We see products these pneumatic compression boots, but they're clunky, time consuming, and they do not fit into the active lifestyle of today's athletes. But now athletes have a better, easier, portable, mobile recovery solution, Firefly Recovery. Why don't we invite one of our loyal customers, five-time Olympian Carrie Walsh Jennings, to join us and talk about how Firefly has helped her and show you how it works. Hey, Sharks. Hey. Hey. Hey. How are you guys? Great. We're good. What an honor. You guys are crushing it. As you can see, the Firefly gently stimulates the paranal nerve in the leg to cause the foot to flutter. We call that the Firefly flutter. This flutter action acts as a natural pump to increase systemic blood flow, speed up recovery times while reducing soreness. We move three times more blood flow than compression. Sharks 800 pro and college teams are already purchasing the Firefly. , who wants to set the athletic recovery market on fire and join us on team firefly? , where is the injury per se on Carrie? Yeah. No injury at all. We're talking about recovery. , you work out, these athletes are training hard for their events and then after that they want to recover faster they can perform better the next day. , we used to think of recovery as a day that you take off, but recovery is a lifestyle. You want to eat better, you want to sleep better, all those things. But a big component of recovery is circulation. Anthony, can you pull those compression legs out? Yes. , I'm a huge investor in TheraBody. They're a percussion recovery company that has massage guns. , I feel you're talking to me now with those compression legs and I wear them because I'm getting older. Are you saying that this device replaces the need to wear those compression legs, which I have to sit on the chair, prop my legs up, my kids think I'm an alien because my legs get swelled up and they come down. I can put that on my leg and walk around and assume life is normal and I don't have to wear that. Absolutely. Lord have mercy. Can we get a world-class athlete to also tell us from her user side? Yeah. , I have been a pro alete for over 20 years. I retired, which still hurts my heart to say out loud. , but when I'm training and trying to be best in the world and win gold medals, I would use them and I would notice my legs are lighter. I'm fresher. Is this only for legs? It's a great question. , 70% of our blood is in our lower extremities, ? All we're doing is using your nervous system to pump it back to your heart faster. , it's a systemic flush. It's called on pulse technology. That's the nerve stimulation. Do you have a patent for this? , nine families of patents, 47 patents in total. They are utility patents and it this product is patent protected. All guys, let's talk about the big shakaroo in the room. Two and a half% for 500,000 is a 20 million valuation. Why in the world do you think you are worth $20 million? Because I love to shred around valuation and I'm getting the weasel out in me. Lifetime sales we're at 7.5 million. It's not going to do it. The last 12 months were 4 million. We are on track this year to do 5 1.5 million. We are growing at a fast rate. The first few years of the technology was focused on teams. We didn't have a direct to consumer business. One quick question about the product. Speaking of the consumer, we're over the product. Merit. No, I'm over you. I want to talk about valuation because it's the big shakaroo in the room. You are not worth $20 million. food. Listen, 25 years ago when I started in the investment space at Goldman Sachs, this is the first thing they taught me. There's no such thing as a bad deal. It's bad prices. And now, this smells a good deal, but at a bad price. , let me ask you a couple questions. What was the total amount you raised in the past? Cuz I feel you're jacking this valuation because you're trying to appease some old investors. In 2022, we did an athlete seed round. We raised a million dollars with professional athletes and friends and family. That was at a 10 million pre- money valuation. my god. Wow. And that's all you've raised total? That's all we've raised total. How much does it cost you to make it and how much you sell it for? Landed cost is $1,730. Retail. These sell for $48 for one set. And And how long does this last? If you did recovery every single day your athletes, they're going to get a whole month. Don't they get pissed off that you've got to keep on buying again and again and again? They're not unhappy with the product because you're going to get 15 treatments per pack. Guys, I love the product. I you guys. Carrie, congratulations on your success honoring the country this way. I love it all. Evaluation is a real sticking point for me on this one. I don't think you're worth 20. , I wish you the best of luck. I'm out. Thank you. guys, I think I'm a little confused on a lot of the things that was said here. I don't I don't know enough at such a high valuation with where this is now. Too confusing for me. , I'm out. Thank you, Damon. , guys, let me tell you where I'm at. Look, it sounds amazing. Sounds it works. I can see our guys using it, but at its price, $48 a month to get this recovery as opposed to maybe not as good with the leggings is different. We're gonna The idea of spending $48 a month is insane for 99.99%. What would you pay to feel better? No. , seriously, I think you're looking at it wrong. It's $3 a treatment, ? , if I'm training for No, it's not a treatment. Look, it's recovery. Recovery is not a treatment unless you're a professional athlete. No, no, no. If you're training for a marathon, if you're a CrossFit athlete, you got to be rich to do it. Someone who pumps iron. Starbucks is $5 a cup. We're talking $48 a month. That's every subscription you have for every streamer that you have. , that's how people will think about it for those reasons. See, I don't agree with that at all. Thank you, Mark. , I see a real market for it. , and I see it the real market as being direct to consumer. Yes. As people age, if they've been active in seven people are turning 65 every minute in this country. There you go. I think it's a great product and I think there's a lot of promise. Roshan and I were talking. He agrees with me. , we have an offer together. Yeah. , gonna pull a card from from your deck here. I I never thought I would do it, man. Every time I hear your deals. Don't go there. Three sharks are out, but Lori and Rashawn are interested in Anony's and Lauren's workout recovery product, Firefly. , we'll offer you the $500,000 for 5%. We want a $1.50 50 cent royalty until we get our money back and then 50 cent in perpetuity thereafter and we will make sure you guys take this to the next level. You are wise grasshopper. Yes. in terms of the royalty offer, first of all, we appreciate your offer. we are already investing much back into the business. We were not looking to add a royalty to the business now because we want to be able to continue to invest and grow in the business. , what's your counter? Yes, we would come up from the 2 1/2% to 3 1/2% for the 500,000. Come on. In perpetuity royalty, you have a problem with we Yeah, that always is an issue. 50 cents is not going to ruin your business. 50 cents could ruin your business. , they made a counter, guys. What are you going to do? , look, first I think your last round with the athletes was mispriced. If the issue is the actual royalty, we can talk about that. Our concern is that we never get our money back. You guys never sell this business. But you're a VC, Rashan. I know. I need my money on exits and selling the company. Can I talk about the valuation? Prior to coming in here, we did have informal conversations with PE and venture. And for this category, they were saying four to six times rev is a good I'll say it for him. We don't care. We're sharks. , we did come in below that because you are sharks. I don't want to negotiate against ourselves. We countered there. It's only one thing that you're not anticipating. You're going to take millions of dollars and spend it on marketing and you're going to get a million dollars of marketing from us for free. I have a separate marketing agent that I would charge him an average of 3 million a year for this. far, our final offer is 500. I think we should do this. , we'll count on your offer. , if we remove the royalty, we need our 5%. , no royalty, 5% for $500,000. Our is our counter and final offer. Pretty clean deal. That should be easy. Yes. You guys appreciate that is clean. , coming in here, we obviously did have our top level point we could go to and we felt that was 4%. That would be unfortunate. You're going to let 100 basis points and you're going to walk out without a deal. 1% you're going to let quit the deal. that's crazy. Any investor in the country would tell you don't be delusion sensitive. to be success sensitive. And now that 100 basis points could cost you guys hundreds of millions of dollars. I see hundreds if not thousands of pitches. It's impossible to get where you are. And you're going to walk out for 100 basis points, 1%. You're nuts. You're absolutely nuts if you do that. You are. What do you guys want to do? We're going to take a moment. Thank you. What's that evaluation? , , we had a game plan when we came in and Tyson said, , everybody's got a plan until somebody punches you in the face. We appreciate the punch and we would love to take the deal with you guys. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Gives me chills. nice meeting you. I'm sorry for that. That was one of the scariest things I've ever done in my life. Congrats, guys. done. my gosh. We did it. Back to the grind. Honestly, we've been grinding since we started. It's not going to change. It's going to add more fuel to the fire. And I'm sure they're going to be great at, , opening our eyes up to how to run this business differently and and better.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First, first (ORDINAL), Firefly Recovery, Firefly (WORK_OF_ART), Firefly Recovery, Goldman Sachs, Starbucks, Anony, PE (ORG), Olympian (NORP), Firefly (PRODUCT), TheraBody, VC (GPE), 65 every minute (TIME), Rashan (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, the product, the firefly, those compression legs, my legs, the business, 100 basis points, their recovery\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 500,000\n  \u2022 do: athletes\n  \u2022 track: recovery\n  \u2022 see: products\n  \u2022 have: recovery solution\n  \u2022 invite: one\n  \u2022 crush: it\n  \u2022 stimulate: paranal nerve\n  \u2022 flutter: acts\n  \u2022 move: blood flow\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.16)\n\n**Topics:** recovery, guy, athlete, leg, firefly",

And we're best friends, cocktail lovers, and the busy bees behind Barb's Bartending. We've created a unique way for you to celebrate and learn to make cocktails from your own space. Barbies is a mobile cocktail class company shaking up memorable experiences for friends, family, and anyone feeling the buzz. When you book a Barbie mobile cocktail class, an instructor shows up at your space to lead a class full of cocktail shaking and spirited conversation. You provide the liquor and the location, and we provide the rest. , all you do is show up and be your own mixologist. In a Barbie class, an instructor guides you through making delicious cocktails. Whether you want to stir things up at your bachelorette party, corporate team building, or birthday celebration, a Barbie's cocktail class provides a fresh way to celebrate and connect together. , Sharks, we're seeking $75,000 for 10% equity to join the Barbies Hive. , take a shot on us and get buzzed with Barbies. Sharks, in front of you is our most popular two Barbies cocktails, the Rosemary Honey Paloma and Strawberry Old-Fashioned. Let's drink up. We'll join you. [Applause] that. Cheers, Sharks. Cheers. tasty. In the new world we're living where everybody's working hybrid or offline there is a need for community in corporations a lot of people are feeling lonely. There is a need for us to connect. , we feel that need for sure. we launched in 2019 as an event bartending company. Precoid in Nashville, Tennessee. We were slinging drinks at large scale events, weddings, things that. Are we both bartenderes? We are. Yes. We used to be us and now we have a team of 25. Tell us about your background. We met at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. And we started Barbies while I was still in school. I got a call one day from Willow and she said, Hey, do you want to go to bartending school on a complete whim? , what are your sales? , in 2019, we grossed $19,000. Got it. In 2020, when we transitioned to virtual classes, we were still able to almost double our revenue and hit 38,000. Got it. In 2021, as we came out of the pandemic, we transitioned those virtual classes into in-person classes, and we nearly doubled again at 76,000. And last year, we expanded to four new cities, and we grossed under $190,000. Good for you. Good for you. What's going to happen this year? This year, we are expected to gross $400,000. We We have expanded to four brand new cities. , now we are in seven cities. People are not too busy for connection and specifically bachelorettes and corporate groups which are our top two demographics. They eat this up over and over again. We do 52% of our business in the bachelorette scene and 26% is corporate. What do you need from a shark? what we need from a shark is help with expansion. We know that as a service our number one strategic advantage is taking up the market. There's no one doing what we do in as many places as we do it and we want to make sure it stays that way. , we want to spend $20,000 on an automated booking platform. We want to automate everything. Secondly, we want to spend $20,000 on enhanced onboarding. We need to be able to bring people on quickly and efficiently. And , that means branding our bartend. Our cocktail class instructors. And then lastly, we want to spend the remainder of of your money on expanding your money, which takes approximately $5,000 for each city in the first six months. , look, what you're doing is great. And obviously you both are entrepreneurs. I'll give you the snaps, ? done. The challenge for me is that opening up a city now helps you grow. But once you get to all the cities you want to go to, growing from there gets hard and expensive. And I think that puts a lid on your business in terms of what I need to see in terms of scale. I'm out. I love what you're doing, but I don't want to be in the service industry. , , good luck. I'm out. Thank you. Here's where I'm at with it. I think you guys are the real deal. Thank you. I sell a lot of wine. Millions and millions and millions of bottles of wine. If this was more of a wine play, I think I'd be all over it. But this would be against the energy I put into supporting LI Fine Wines. I I wish you the best. I'm out. Listen guys, what you're doing. I think it'd be fun to work with you guys. We built a film marketing team across the country with kind and we had to build all of the systems to be able to create calendars, to create tracking, to create a resource book. , we've done a lot of that. I don't think you came with a crazy number, but I I would do this for 20%. 20%. Yeah. I love you guys and I think what you're doing is phenomenal. I think he gave you a fantastic offer, better than what I would have and I think he's the partner for you. I'm out. I am getting a little bit worried for Daniel. Now you're the only person and everybody said that it was a good deal. Daniel, I your offer is wonderful. , you should say yes. We're honored. Would you do 15? No, but if we take longer, it might go to 25%. Would you do 20% for for $75,000? Is there any wiggle room here? I am I am thinking my kids earned the to get a pet and I will advocate for us to name their pet Barbie. That's weird. Upgrade. my god. That is your upgrade. You're about to lose this thing. , you got the drink. Good job. Good job. Thank you much. Thank you for caring about this the way we care about it. Great job. Congratulations, guys. I think this is a testament to us saying yes to things. I hope that entrepreneurs out there are watching this saying, \"I can say yes, too. I can jump in. I can try it.\" It might be ramshackle at first, but that's . We all start that way. try it. Say yes. Find a good partner that you trust with your whole heart. And it's going to be such a beautiful journey.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 10%, 52%, 26%, 20%, 25% (PERCENT), Strawberry Old-Fashioned, Belmont University (ORG), Nashville, Tennessee (GPE), Secondly, first (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** a lot, you guys, an instructor, a need, a shark, your money, good job, the tank\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 create: way\n  \u2022 provide: liquor\n  \u2022 guide: you\n  \u2022 provide: way\n  \u2022 seek: 75,000\n  \u2022 take: shot\n  \u2022 join: you\n  \u2022 be: need\n  \u2022 feel: need\n  \u2022 sling: drinks\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.30)\n\n**Topics:** cocktail, class, way, thing, barbie",

out Robert are you buying two of these no I'll tell you why I'm not buying the product and I'll demonstrate something for you Nathan I went to the doctor with the twins the first time and I was swinging the babies around and doing it all badly and the doctor looked at me and said you haven't done this for a while have you he goes let me show you an easier way to do it do that carry it around this that's better you could do this a lot longer than you can do this but you could do that a lot longer than you could do the twist I tell you you're a great salesman but let me tell you what is of great concern to me it's your judgment the idea that you could spend $750,000 developing this product is mindboggling to me you went and got all these patents before you had sales what could other the patents if you don't have the sales as much as I you I'm out look does anybody want this product the patents intrigue me the revenues don't I'm out thank you Nathan first of all I loved your super hop model and the two babies love that I admire how you got to Market I completely disagree with Kevin if you can get 200,000 in sales in 2 years on a $30 product that's a lot of volume unit I applaud you for that thank you and still you won't buy it I accept people are buying it but I'm carrying around baby seats all the time I don't carry them long enough where I would think I would need this if I'm

Sharks, mushrooms have been blowing up in popularity. They're a culinary delicacy. They offer incredible health and cognitive benefits. But these mushrooms are hard to find at most grocery stores, and growing them yourself can be even harder. That's exactly why we created Terishroom. Terasum is a fully automated mushroom growth computer that helps anyone, anywhere grow lab quality mushrooms with zero experience from the comfort and safety from your own home. You turn it on, you fill up the water tank, you then place the ready torow mushroom block inside the terishroom, you select the mushroom you want to grow in the app, and that's it. You have mushrooms growing. And this is a product that makes it simple and affordable for everyone. , , sharks, we would love for you to join us and build something magical with us. Thank you. It's cool. They look flowers. Jared, do you provide the mushroom with a the the grow chamber, the grow computer? Yes. , happy to talk about the business model quick. , , we have a printer and ink cartridge business model, ? , we sell the grow chamber for $3.99 and then on the back end, we have a subscription where we sell these ready torow mushroom cakes for 30 bucks a piece. How much does this cost you to make? $158. 158. That's . And then what does a shroom block cost? 351. This is where we make a lot of cash. How long does it take for a girl block to become that a fruing body? It depends on what you're growing. Some varieties such as oysters can grow in as little as 7 days. Some reishi can take longer up to 6 weeks. a lot of people they love them because they view it as a functional art piece. , with the mood lighting, the embedded time-lapse camera. This is something that they show off to their friends on social media and it's it's a brag point. You're a mushroomologist. Micologist. Yes. A micologist. You're a pretty bright guy. You can tell. Where did this come from? Yeah. , it started about 7 years ago. I was in college. I was growing mushrooms in my dorm. Of course you were. Of course I was. , and it it was something that I had a natural interest in and I decided I want to get into product building. , I bought some 3D printers, figured out CAD modeling, basic micro electronics. And it started off as a weekend hackathon project and there was a lot of interest. And where we're at now is we have 6,500 paid customers, 22 6,500. Yes. And 22,500 people on the email wait list. I got back from Shanghai last week. We're rolling out mass production. 22,000 back orders. 22,000 people on the email wait list. Weight list. What does that mean? What does that mean? They they signed up to get a small discount. Can you walk us through your sales history? Yeah. Terishroom started back in August 2022. I started running ads on Facebook and since then we've generated $780,000 in revenue total. Total. Yeah. But keep in mind we haven't shipped out yet. Yeah. And Wait, wait, wait, wait. You haven't shipped any yet? I got back from Shanghai. you said you sold 6,500 units pre-sale. I'm sorry. Pre-sales. No, you didn't say that. , I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. You've taken 78,000 of pre-orders in two years and not shipped a single product. I think I should I should keep selling it without shipping stuff. , that's not horrible if they deliver. It's only horrible if they don't deliver. Two years, Mark. No, they haven't. We collect the money for 2 years. Yeah, he has. No, no. Here, let me clarify this. , we started Facebook ads in Q4 2022. We shut them off because what happened was I had a a prototype. I was told by a product development company that was , yeah, we can get this done in a couple months. I was , Sweet, we're almost there. I realized that was not the truth. it was back to the draw and even make a mold in a couple of months. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. what happened is I was , I need to build a team that is on the cap table and we are all in this and not someone who's going to charge a per hour or a consultancy fee. But that was 2 years ago. Why haven't you shipped 50 of them or some element of , , , frankly, , we've we've overengineered this. We we didn't want to ship out hundreds and get a refund problem. When are you going to ship your first,000 units and have them in the market? , we're going to have 1,140 units shipped to our Austin warehouse by July, Jared, but I think it's cool, ? And if it turns out to work, it could be nice, but you oversell. You're not there and ready to deliver yet. And that's a whole different level of uncertainty and and terror. I can see it being great for you. , I'm excited for you. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Jared. But I think it's beautiful. I think it's exciting, but I think your valuation is way, way, way off. And for that reason, I'm out. Understood. Thank you. Wish you the best. It's a beautifully designed product. You're a highly credible guy. But we had to ask you if you shipped any. You didn't tell us that. It always makes me nervous when I have to find out such a crucial fact and pull it out. I can't get there. I'm out. Thank you. I love hydroponic farming. I think it's cool. There's no pesticides. Exactly. It's safer. But this seems to me overengineered. If it was simply something where you watered it, it could grow. It's got the light. Without the camera, without the app, it would be a much simpler contraption. , I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Neighbor. , all fungi lead back to Mr. Wonderful. I the idea. I I'm willing to take a flyer on it, but not at your valuation. I'll give you the 175. I go on the ride for 15%. Are you ready? honestly, I don't think you're ready to take on an investor. , he can make a decision. Are you going to walk out of here without a deal or I become an investor and I put my team on it and we get you more orders than you've ever dreamt of? Why do you think 15%. It's my intuition after doing deals for decades. If this works, we're going to have to raise a lot more money for inventory alone, ? And I'm willing to take that risk, but it's embedded in the valuation. Kevin, , respectfully, we we raised a lot more money at a much higher valuation. , I I totally respect that, but they are not me. I don't think you're ready to put the product out on the market. Even if you're about He has no choice but to put it on the market. No, he does have a choice cuz he has a brand that he doesn't want to destroy. He doesn't have a brand yet. He hasn't shipped a unit yet. He's got,40 coming that he's already spent the money on the thing that a person can do ever. No, you don't got it because you're going to invest in it and you don't even I'm willing to take that chance. I already talked about it. I'm going to be honest with you. The biggest problem that a person making a product can do is putting it out on the market when it is not ready. That is true. It can destroy you, your credibility, all the people that were behind you. And Jared, I'm willing to take that chance and then get back. Lori, we got it. I'm willing to take that chance and invest in you. 175,000 for 15%. I'll do that deal. I have no flexibility. What do you want to do? That is a That is a number that it's absolutely not going to work. Kevin, I could do 5%. And let me tell you why. Because , you don't have to go any further. I'm out. Thank you, Jared. Thank you.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hello, my name is Ben FSY and I'm Melissa FSY and my company is Caddyy Swag. We're here today to ask for $60,000 in exchange for 20% of our company. Now, as we all know, there's two types of golfers in this world. There's the serious golfer and then what we call the caddyy sway golfer. The caddyy swway golfer is your average everyday golfer whose score is secondary to having a good time on the course. That's why I invented the par six. The par six is designed to fit inside the shoe pocket of any golf bag. The par six also keeps six 12 oz cans cold for 18 holes guaranteed without ice. how each cooler comes with a customized refreezable gel pack which is guaranteed to keep the cans cold. Now, not only does this PAR six pay for itself the first time you use it, but it can save you anywhere from 20 to $30 per round of golf. How? Golf course six-pack will cost you anywhere from about $25 to $35 plus tip. A six-pack at the corner store cost you about five or six bucks. , by keeping your cans cold with the Par 6, you've saved 20 to $30. And if you call today, you can get your Par 6 cooler for $19.99. But wait, order in the next 10 minutes and we're going to double your order. Two par six coolers for $19.99, plus shipping and handling. But wait, there's more. No, that's . There is more. We've made the first ever Shark Tank version of the PAR 6. Ben, are there golf courses that have any rules about being able to bring your own beverages? There are some courses that, , frown upon you bringing your own onto the course, but there's also a lot of golf courses out there that don't provide any type of beverage service at all whatsoever. Interesting idea. What are your sales now? We're averaging $15,000 in sales a year since we've started far. But it's important to point out that that's by word of mouth only. We have not invested any money into advertising at this time. And that I don't clutter the space with everybody else who are golf afficionados, I'm out. I play a lot of golf. There is no golf course out there that will allow you to bring your own beverages in. that. I disagree. But that there's consumers that are carrying their beverages on the course. Agreed. And they What's the difference between that consumer simply taking a small cooler and putting it in the back of the golf cart? , because then you're advertising that you have your own beverages on the on the golf cart. We'll show you what our current competition looks . And this is what it is. And it's a mess. It doesn't stay cold for 18 holes. It leaks inside the inside the pocket of your golf bag. This will not do that. Ben, if I gave you the 60,000, what would you use it for? We'd order 10,000 units at $3 a piece. We take the remainder of the money and we would look at putting an advertising campaign together in targeted markets to be able to turn the product over. We're selling them now for two for $19.99. That's a profit margin of $13.99. Now, I'm no math major, but I'm pretty sure at $13.99, you only have to get 71,500 orders to gross a million dollars. There's over 36 million golfers in the United States. Ben, I'm no math major either, but $15,000 in sales per year is pretty close to zero. It's a cooler bag, and there's a huge market of devices that cool all kinds of things. My kids have coolers this with exactly the same thing in different shapes. , I think if someone is motivated to bring beverages onto the golf course, they don't need your back. There's a million different uses that you can use this for. You got to remember the promotional market as . What's unique about it? What's patentable? What's what makes this cooler better than the thousand other coolers my wife and kids buy? One, we've we've changed the corner on it where the zipper attaches to the cooler itself to prevent any leaking if you were to use it for ice. And that is what does make it patentable. But there are coolers that don't need ice. Absolutely. But they're not shaped in this they're not shaped in this fashion. Again, the the only thing that's unique about this is the shape of the cooler and the corner, as he explained. It doesn't leak ice. And the functionality, it fits in every single golf bag or your money bag. Wouldn't you agree, the best place to advertise this is the Golf Channel? Absolutely. . And I'm going to tell you now on the Golf Channel, most products are going to give you a lower score, ? . This is a product that's a frivolous type product that it, , it to me it doesn't have enough punch to it to get the phone to ring. , I'm out. [Music] I think it's a trivial product. I don't think you're going to sell many. I think you have an uphill battle. It solves a need. Yeah. It pays for itself the first time you use it and it saves golfers money every time moving forward. I'm out. I think there is a need for the product. I have two brothers, both roofers, that consistently sneak beer onto the golf course and they probably need four or five of these cuz they drink a ton. You're absolutely . But it's still a small business. It's not the business that you get an investor to put their money in cuz it couldn't get the money back out. It would take too darn long. , I'm out. You're making something that already exists already in a thousand different iterations. There's nothing to invest in. And I'm depressed now because I know with certainty there's no chance that I can ever make any money with you. Let me ask you a question. When you go out on the golf course, do you want to pay $6 for for one cold beer or do you want to be able to get a six-pack? You got to be kidding me. , hey, let's face it. The people that have the most money are the ones that are watching the bottom dollar. They're the ones that do not want to spend the money that's out on the golf course. Seriously, you think you're going to create a multi-million dollar business by saving people a couple of bucks on a beer? I think that we can sell hundreds of thousands of these of these units and make money on it and make money for you guys as . I'm out. Thank you for your time. Do we get our coolers back then since you don't want them? . , we're going to go ahead and let you guys keep paying for all of your beverages on the course. Got to go make money on these.

It's a tedious task that we have to do over and over again. As a hairy brown girl with sensitive skin, I've left many waxing salons with less hair, but my skin my skin was collateral damage. Wall Shark's hair removal has never been sweeter. . Say hello to Sugar Dough at home. sugaring kits to remove any hair. We to say we got your back and your front, arms, legs, and anywhere else. Made with sugar, water, and citrus, our all natural sugar-based dough gently pulls hair from the root while exfoliating your skin, leaving feeling silky smooth. And it's a gentle, compostable alternative to waxing. , Sharks, I'm the sugar mama to sugar dough. , I'm asking for some serious dough. I'm seeking $500,000 for 5% of the company. But first, come on. Kendra, my friend Rishot here is in need of some sugaring himself. Do you want to come up and be his sugar mama and sugar with me? I do. I get to remove. my gosh, this is exciting. Kevin's back. Make her do Kevin's back. Yes, I know. Are you serious? This is my dream come true. , sugar dough is made with this taffy goop and it is fun to play with. It's similar to caramel or taffy made with similar ingredients as . . What do I do? , you can try on this side. . , all . Tell me if I'm doing this . . I'm going to mold it into your skin. I'm going to have I'm going to let it heat up a minute. Exactly. And I'm going to help it. And then you want to pull taut with the other hand. , pull the skin taut and then 3 2 1. Woo! my god. You did a good job, Kendra. That's satisfying. That was awesome. I'm going to dismiss Resot. Thank you much. Good job. Try to wrap my head around the 500,000 5% 10 million valuation. This innovation is ancient. It was found in Phoenician times. Women have been using it forever. Yes. All through the Mediterranean. Yes. And there is zero proprietary elements to it. Anybody can do this. help me, help me, help me get to $10 million. We've worked two years to create a proprietary manufacturing process and also our own formulation. that's where we have some of our own IP to be able to you do your process is the IP. Yes. Exactly. now would be a good time to tell us a little about sales. Sales. Sales. Sales. I would love to tell you about our sales. I launched in September 2020 as a solo entrepreneur and at that point at the end of the year I made 50k in revenue. Got it. Fast forward to 2021 we went viral on Tik Tok and we made $2.6 million in sales. From 50,000 to 2.6 50,000 to 2.6. That's what I'm talking about. And then last year we ended the year in $5.6 million in sales. Wow. Wow. , we first started in DTOC and then we grew to Amazon and then at the end of 2022, we made it in 300 Ulta Beauty stores. Last year, we expanded full nationwide and into 1300 stores. And , that's where we had that big bump in sales. Did you make money on the 5.6? No, we didn't make money. How's that possible? We didn't make money. in order to make profits in retail, we learned the hard way that you need 85 90% margins. Our margins were around 60%. However, this year we updated our suppliers and we implemented our manufacturing process and our margins are now hovering around 80%. Did you lose money or? Yes, we lost money last year. How much did you lose? We ended the year at 777%. you lost $440ome,000. How did you fund all those losses? Me and my husband invested $400,000 of our personal lost more. You lost 400. then that's that goes into our debt that we have now. How much debt do you have? We have $1.5 million. Hello. There we go. Yeah. We also have $1 million in inventory. But it also means that you have no cash now. We have no cash now. That's why I'm here in the Shark Tank. Yeah. That is what you need. That is what I need now. Yeah. Especially if we want to get into more retailers. You can't afford to go into more retailers. We have debt financing which is at a high interest rate of 22%. Wow. Hello. There it is. your total debt is 1.5. Yeah. That's what's killing us now is because 20% of the money that we borrow is out the door. We had all this money tied up in inventory and now we're sizing. much has changed in the last few months. Going through hyperrowth you did Yeah. is hard. Yes. borrowing money to get there put you even further underwater because you're all it feels you can never catch up and and get even . Yeah. I wish I had a way where I could say here you go. This is the approach. But I thought when I walked in and saw it I thought this was food and I got hungry. I don't know this stuff at all. for those reasons I'm out. But I wish you the best. . Thank you Mark. I appreciate it. The ask is too big without even fighting about the valuation. I would never value this at 10 million now. You've got sales. I that. But you got a long way to go. It It's, , if you'd come in here for 100, 150, even 200, maybe I take the ride, change the valuation a bit, but this is nuts. I think it's nuts. , for that reason, I'm out. Thank you, Kevin. Yeah. , it's hard because you couldn't predict that you were going to go this high and then as soon as you got that that level, , you had to learn what you didn't know, ? the the amount of margin on these things and then you got to borrow money against it. You can't leave Ultra empty-handed when they asking for goods. Yeah. But to give you $500,000 for 5% you would have to distribute $10 million. if you going if you're doing , that's to get your money back. If you to get my money back, that means you probably would have to do in this model $50 million. You'd be older than the Phoenetians that invented this by the time you got your money back. I'm out. Thank you much, Aaliyah. You're amazing, by the way. And I, , as you were talking, I've been there. , I made some of these same mistakes. I did my business on a line of credit. I was bootstrapping everything. I had credit card debt. , I it was hard to get anybody to invest in me, ? I know how what that feels , but what you're accomplishing is , exciting. , you went from 28 to 56. , I love what you're doing. This is not my business and I'm a little worried about the amount of debt that you have, honestly. , can before you say no, I'm willing to make a deal and that's why I'm here. I have worked my butt off for the last four years and grown super fast to be able to get to the point where I'm at now. And I would partnership. And you are sharks. You guys love problems. This is a great problem to solve. Not sure we love. We do know we love problems. We love solving solving problems. Y'all are problem solver. You would want to be here. The 500 that's a big ask. And and it's not even going to put even a little bit of damp on what you've already got to deal with, ? It's not going to solve a lot of problems. But I do admire you. I'm out. . Thank you. I appreciate it. One of the things that concerns me truly is the competitive market. And I wish you good luck, but I'm sorry I'm out. . All . Thank you guys much. I appreciate it. Thank you. I am disappointed that I'm walking out without a deal. I think that with the sales that we had that they could see the potential, but I love surprising people. I love proving people wrong.

I didn't get a chance to use it, but my wedding planner, Mikey, booked you guys in and I saw the photos after and I was , Wow, the photos are amazing. Why are the photos good? , , it's a number of things. , photo booths have been around forever. They've always been cheap and tacky and childish and gimmicky and low quality and we're both photographers and we wanted to take studio quality photographs in a photo booth experience something that's instant and something that's quick and but tell me what what's unique. through flattering lighting that's huge lighting as you guys know is big. software we have software that instantly goes in and gives you a tasteful amount of retouching. What does the software do? How does it work? my background was also in fashion in terms of photography and I'm used to sitting for two, three days at a time, , retouching. what we decided was why can't you retouch in 4 seconds? There's got to be a way to do it, ? That's an app. There's an app called Smoothing that does that nicely. There's a lot of apps that do this. Yeah. There's nothing. You guys pre-seelelect a filter that you think is most appropriate, but there's there's no secret sauce there. we've said, you've been at a couple events. You guys are the hot brand, the hot photo booth now. tell us what that's translated into and how are you going to stay hot? I think in terms of dollars if we want to talk about that sales that's why we're here. Sure. Sales in three years are north of 4 million. and how much machines do you have now? We have nine machines. And tell us about the business model. baseline price in larger markets in New York or Los Angeles is 27.50. That would get you the photo booth itself and the printing. We also have the texting the social media aspect of it. Those are add-ons. What's the highest package? 36.50. is a mainly weddings, bar mitzvah, festive type of our core business model has been live events. We've busted our butts for three years now, 24/7. It's the west coast, ? All over the country. now we work all over the US. You package this up. You ship it. We take it on a plane with us. But Sean, you did 1.4 with nine. What how do you do more? If you had more machines, would you sell more? Absolutely. , that's also why we're here. We need more machines. We need marketing. We need sales. But on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, we are at capacity. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ? They're not being used. You can't meet the demand now. We're telling people no. What does the machine cost? This machine would cost $22,000. Ouch. And how much money did you raise to start this? We didn't. It's all your own money. How much did you put up? , it's a funny , we think 250,000. We think it's a little more than that. We stopped counting at 250. But you came up with the lighting people have a good experience. Sure. That's a win, ? That's what matters at the end of the day. But as a potential investor, I'm not getting a sense that there were any unique filters that were in there. It's one filter, ? , that's what I'm saying. Producing 500 events a year. We're taking care of our families. We're putting food on the table. And good for you. What is the thing that you have that's valuable? This demand, high quality, high quality demand. We can't meet demand. We're in four markets. Yeah. But this is something other people can replicate. If somebody can replicate it that easy, why haven't they done it? . You develop one filter. That's your That's all your IP or what else? There is competition, but what I'm trying to figure out is the return on investment. now, we're making 400,000 pre-tax. You get my 350. What does the next 12 months look ? , one, we would scale live events. That's simple. You double that quickly. Venues is where we want to go. And this is where different business. It is a different business. And again, that's why we're here. We we clearly have a skill set. , you think I'm going to pay you at the Mavs Arena to come in and do this? Yes. No. Why would they we feel differently because we are in conversations with some of the biggest retailers in the world. Look, congratulations. I'm not trying to take away anything from what you've accomplished. It's more about what I see in terms of an investment, ? It's expensive and complicated and a lot of people are going to use that as an entree into this business. , for those reasons, I'm out. . Sorry to hear that. Mark, I love this product and Mark is talking about it from more technical geek side, ? I'm talking about it from a consumer side. , I love this product, but I notice myself every other day I buy a new gadget in regards to taking a picture. But what I'm saying is I'm always finding something new. And this market changes fast that I'm afraid that you may have a good run for 3 years, 5 years, and change with it or you may not. The market's moving too fast for me. , I'm out. Sorry to hear about that. I don't see how this works in the stadium and event arena that because I think people are engaged in the event more than they're going to go find in a corner your booth. If you had said you want to blow this up for parties, weddings, be premium, the Cadillac or the Mercedes of this, I would have been in. But because of the direction you want to take it, but I think it's going out. I'm sorry to hear that cuz it's both. But how do I get my dough back if I'm a 10% shareholder? , I think I could get your money back by expanding core business and doubling that in 12 to 18 months. All of the concerns about change in technology will occur. There's also a wedding next Sunday and somebody's going to pay for this thing. I look at it as a company that can support debt. , here's an offer. You don't have to take it, but I'm not sure you're going to get anything else. It's always a good sign, ? You don't have to take it. No, because I don't want to take the risk of being a minority shareholder with no exit. I'll loan you $350,000 at 18% interest. I want 5% equity in the company as a fee for providing that line. It's the lone shark tank again. No, it isn't. If you have a better structure, Robert, you should provide. Are you done, Mr. Le? I'm not finished yet. There's more. I happen to think you have to run hell. And I think the more machines you get, the more cash you'll make. I'd be careful with your assumptions about those other venues. What I'd to see is you put them in a couple proved out your theory. Sure. Meanwhile, you're doing weddings. I love the business. It's fantastic. I'm with you on the venues. Thank you. I'm I agree with Kevin in that you got to run. You got to go to every market. We absolutely agree. That's why we're standing here. , we've turned down money to be here now. You got to go fast. I the corporate idea. I think that's going to be big. But I need more equity. How do I get more equity? , what's your offer? I need more than 10%. How much do you need? I'd love to have 50%. 50? What? A full partnership? Would you do a full partnership? Why would you do that? We wouldn't. , I'm asking. , you're valuing the business at $700,000. No, I'm not asking for that dollar amount. What dollar amount would you need at 50%? I couldn't do a deal at 50%. You couldn't? No. , hell no. At 50%. Cuz we're turning out cash. There's no way I'm going to No, I'm asking the question. It was a question. I wanted to know what would you sell 50% for? , we think that we think we think it's more valuable than that. You're asking for 350,000 for 10%. . Meaning the entire thing is worth three and a half million today, ? He doesn't want to sell control position. I think he's made it clear. . , I'm h I'm happy to entertain more equity. I think we're going to explode. I think we're going to get big. What's the most equity you would sell today? For the dollar amount, I would entertain maybe 18 to 20%, but that's on the high side. Would you do 20% for 700,000? Same valuation, more equity at the same price. 20% for 700,000. I think I would do that. Yes. Because it would allow me to expand even that much faster. I'll give you 700,000 for 20%. [Applause] Yeah. Yeah. We'll take your deal. Got it. There you go. [Music] I'm excited. We're going to go kill it. We're going to kill it. Thanks, guys. Hey, we appreciate your help. Hey, let's get a picture. Let's get a picture. [Music] Love it. It's excited. Thank you. It's cute cuz you toys. Love toys. And this is the ultimate toy. While we appreciate Kevin's offer, we came in for a partnership, not money. Which is why we are happy to be with Robert cuz he again, he saw what we were doing. He gave us the dollars and we're going to go kill it.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Los Angeles, California, New York, US (GPE), 350,000, 22,000, 700,000 (MONEY), first, First (ORDINAL), Mirror Mirror, Mirror, IP, Cadillac (ORG), 4 seconds (TIME), the west coast (LOC), the Mavs Arena (FAC), three and a half million (QUANTITY)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, more equity, the photos, a picture, los angeles, the photo booth, the world, a couple\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 meet: future\n  \u2022 smooth: skin\n  \u2022 take: photo\n  \u2022 love: other\n  \u2022 love: that\n  \u2022 get: chance\n  \u2022 do: What\n  \u2022 be: app\n  \u2022 be: lot\n  \u2022 be: nothing\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.24)\n\n**Topics:** photo, machine, business, equity, booth",

Each of our signature dishes start out with 33 oz of fresh cut potatoes. That's over three large potatoes in every meal. No one can ever finish one by themselves. Our unique culinary experience combines the comfort of French fries with the irresistible Latin flavors from cultures around the world Colombiano. , Colia, Mexico, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico, and many, many more. Why are you translating for me? They know what I'm saying. They don't speak Spanish. Look, Mr. Wonderful looks confused. , sharks. I can't tell you exactly what she said, but what I can tell you is with our bilingual menu, customers can order in Spanish and have a little fun at the same time. sharks enjoy these Buenas papas as we bring the Savor sensation to America. All , sharks. Who's ready? Let's go to papa. Let's try papa. All , guys. Mr. Mark, what do you have there? Yeah, I got the healthy one here. , healthy salmon makes it healthy. Smoked salmon, sweet potatoes, guac, and pico. That's all healthy. I have regular potatoes, ? , you have the Carolina. That is pulled pork. Pulled pork. I've got to get through. There's four sauces. There's four different sauces. , we have a special one called Buena Sauce. It's our housemade. It's mayo. It's garlicky. It's cilantro. Delicious. I had it. It's delicious. The fries are good. Awesome. , I'm going to give you an ichiwa karamba. It's pretty good. Muchas gracias. And people have fell in love with this since we opened. It's been an crazy amazing ride. When we first opened up, we had $18 in our bank account because we invested everything $18. $18 because we had invested our life savings. we had $40,000 saved and this company started in the pandemic. This idea came to mind. We thought about Latin food when you go on vacation. You're in Cancun or San Juan, Puerto Rico, all those different street foods that you have there and how good it tastes and how can we bring it back to America and adopt it on top of these fries, ? we serve the family. They were our test dummies. They loved it. The kids loved it and they said, \", hey dad, can we have some more?\" And I was , \" what? I may have a business here.\" we opened up July 2021. Where did you open? in Raleigh, North Carolina. After that $18, two weeks later, we had 18,000 in our bank account. Two weeks after that on Tik Tok, we went viral. Influencer came and tried all of our dishes and two days we had 16 million views. 16 16 million. And when I saw people coming and eating those potatoes, I said, \" my god, it's working.\" , tell us about your background. How did you guys meet? Sure. We're we're high school sweethearts. ? We met Yeah, we met the last two weeks of high school and I pursued her nothing other. A that's a prom photo. A look at that. That's us. Yeah. And ever since then, we've been building with each other. Anybody got restaurant experience? Not restaurant experience. , I've been an entrepreneur all my life. I started out working for Queen Latifa at Flavor Unit Entertainment. And at that time, the Latin boom was going on. , I I pitched, how about we do a Latin management, , agency. No one focusing on these on these new Latin stars. And I always been into the Latin culture. Joanne, we havenot heard from you at all. Wow. I talk a lot. . You do talk a lot. I did. I know this. I know this. , , my family immigrated from Columbia, South America in the late 1980s. And when I went to school, nobody could understand me. I ended up being placed in the back of class. I eventually learned how to speak English, ? Yay. , I was the first one to graduate from college for my family. And then I went back to the school where they sat me in the back of the class. And I worked as a teacher for 12 years. . Teaching at that famous school. Talk about triumphing. . , talk about this product. Yes, sir. Tell me about the cost of making it and what you sell it for and what the margins are and your margins. , on average to make any of these dishes, it it ranges about 350 per plate cost. And what do you sell it for? On average 1350. Whats your overall margin? Our food margins are 28%. 28. 28%. Its a little light. Is that your net profit margins or Thats the on average that where it at. 28%. for our food costs. , no. You are saying cost of not your margins, ? Yeah. His margins are 72. . , then you are . Youare in good shape. Today, are you in stores this? , that's our first store. and it's a 200 ft\u00b2 footprint. Yeah. I love that. Our first year, we did 1.1 million. Wow. We took all the profits from that and invested into this store. How big is that one? That one is 700 ft\u00b2. And how is that doing? It is doing . , combined this year, we are going to finish at about 2 million. What did you make last year on the 2 million? Sure. about 200,000. Did you pay yourself paying? We paid ourselves 80,000. , that is what 120. 120. . , you have two stores. , no, no. , we have three stores. The third one is at an arena. , we are opening up a fourth one in Miami this month. Where in Miami? A Windwood Miami. , you will kill it. Yeah, we are excited. We also I didnt mention this. we started franchising. . And on our opening month of our franchising program, we sold four franchises. What do you charge for those? 295 for initial franchise fee. And then how much per month per year? 8% royalty fee. 2% of that is marketing. And how long has the longest one been out there? Is this new? , this is this is brand new. Brand new. we sold these franchises. what are you looking for? We are looking for besides 400,000. , a strategic partnership to help us build this brand. All . We got franchises selling. We are excited about those. We know we can move this company along at a nice snail plate pace. It doesn not sound a snail pace to me. I will tell you the hiccup though. We are a young company. when we go to banks and we walk in, we are looking nice and pretty and they are , \"Yeah, we need some money to open up a new store.\" And they are , \"No, you are still considered a startup.\" that was the issue. we have been taking our own profits in opening up these stores, which I have learned now that it is not healthy. Why is that not healthy? Because we are sucking up all the cash flow. But do you have any debt today? 70,000 of debt on the business. Not nothing huge, ? But I think it is a fundamental question do you would you rather grow with a lot of debt and scale and maybe not make a profit or or do it the way you are doing it? You started this when you only had $18 in your account and now you are running a $2 million business. , you should be proud of that. Thank you. Thank you. But the issue is we want to have more speed because I know that somebody else is going to come into this market. Listen, I think you are doing everything . I think when you race and run with something this where you have to make sure you land in the places, that you do everything correctly, ? It is not you have to blitz the market with it fast. People can not copy that. I would not want to speed it out there. I would not want to race it. I wish you good luck, but I am out. Thank you much, Laura. Thank you much. , the the fiveyear plan for us is to open one corporate store every year in the next 5 years, and that is going to end up at at the end of five years at $10 million. guys, . running a restaurant is a hard business. Once you franchise, you are in a second business. You are in the babysitting business. You are in the daycare business because you are taking $29,500 from somebody and they are buying your dream. And when they want your help, you better be there. . If you guys were in this, I was interested. But you are in two different businesses. I think that is going to crush you. for those reasons, I am out. , wow. Thank you, Mark. impressive. It is delicious, but frankly u with the change of my lifestyle of eating, I I I I would not eat this. And I to get behind the products that I invest in I can use my face to push the business. , I am out. what I think? I think you do not need anybody. I think you have the whole package. You have each other. You are progressing nicely and I think you will continue that way. , I am out. Thank you much. Thank you, Barbara. You still have one shark left. Robert, what are you doing? All , guys. What I've learned is if you find great people, great things can happen. And you guys are amazing. , to go from where you were, no money, to build this size of business, I've been there. . Let's figure out this thing together. . Five. The only thing I hate is the valuation. There's no way this is worth 5.1 million. Let's talk about it. . You're making $120,000 a year. How is it worth 5 million? , Robert, it's 5.7 million valuation. Thank you, Kevin. , after Miami opens up with our four stores and our franchise stores, we should be about 6 million in gross sales. Gross sales next year. But that's not today. It's probably worth about 2 million today. I'm valuing it off of what we're going to do next year. Yeah. , I'm valuing it off what it's worth. I got you. Today, make us. , for me, it's about $2 million. , 400,000 20%. . . Can we counter offer you? That's the beauty of Shark Tank. You can do whatever you want. Let's talk papas. All . The good potato. 15% for the 400k. No. 400,000 20%. I'm going to be there. We're going to invest more. . Let's meet halfway. 17%. Let's close the deal. Eat some papas and let's go. 400,000 20%. Let's go. 18%. 20%. What do you say, honey? Gosh. my goodness. Squeezing the potato. Squeezing 19%. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you, buddy.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Colombian, French, Latin (NORP), 33 oz (QUANTITY), Spanish, English (LANGUAGE), Carolina, South America (LOC), Buena Sauce, Flavor Unit Entertainment, Shark Tank (ORG), first, third, fourth, second (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** puerto rico, you guys, north carolina, no one, all , guys, our bank account, this company, my family\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 love: it\n  \u2022 do: chair salsa\n  \u2022 get: moves\n  \u2022 seek: 400,000\n  \u2022 mean: potato\n  \u2022 create: something\n  \u2022 create: Bueno Papa\n  \u2022 combine: comfort\n  \u2022 speak: Spanish\n  \u2022 enjoy: Buenas papas\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.24)\n\n**Topics:** year, potato, business, store, papa",

for 5% of our company sharks sorry sharks no matter what we try to do to fix the bicycle seat we still suffer from saddle soreness even when we wear uncomfortable padded shorts this riding bikes should be fun the outdoors the fresh air the breeze in your hair or on your aerodynamic head but even after a short ride biking hurts down there it's the undercarriage Calamity it's the gear shifting groin grinding it's the pedal powered private pandemonium and pain they get it Brian crotch pain is real tradition bike Saddles put tooo much pressure on the nerves and arteries restricting the blood flow to the genitals which is why we created the V seed a revolutionary noseless and bumpless bicycle seat ergonomically designed to support the sit bones for prolonged rides the V seat soft pad allows for unrestricted blood flow for both women and men and even though it's slightly pitched forward the slip resistant material will grip your tush the way you thought only your lover could I'm sorry installation is also as easy as adjusting the height of your seat plus it's Ultra durable it's lightweight and you don't have to wear shorts that look diapers sharks who wants take a ride with us and save crotches around the world with the VC I'd to try it yes go ahead and come up we would also love bar I spend about an hour and a half every day on my bikes and I've yet to find a seat that's good Mr Wonderful go ahead and sit on the traditional seat we're going to have you take a couple revolutions you're a cyclist yes I'm also concerned about my package this is uncomfortable all let's try the other go ahead and come over here I'm a little worried about support here that's the risk absolutely that is there you go what's it Kevin yeah how does it feel it's package friendly it's not constrained in any way your rumper Rino is supported I think it is better yeah if you can get Kevin do you feel solid on it let's see what Barbara thinks Works go ahead and take a couple revolutions Barb what's it it's great and I'm surprised because there's no cushioning and yet it feels totally comfortable does it feel better than the other one light ears better it's terrific all J wow thank you much for trying it tell us about what it costs to make and what do you sell them for we sell it on our website for $119 and it costs $2 four landed great margins and how many of you sold tell us about the sales we have sold to far over $300,000 over what period of time over 3 years 26,000 of that came last year and this year we've sold a little over $270,000 gosh 270 what happened was we started advertising on Facebook and Instagram and it blew up from there what's your background and how did you come to create this this whole thing started when Annie told me that she doesn't want to desensitize her ladybits I was shocked as a trainer with over 20 years of experience I knew that the traditional bike saddle was bad I didn't know how bad until she pointed this out to me and we knew something had to be done how about you Annie my background is the American dream come true I was adopted at 3 days old in Iran by an Armenian wonderful Armenian family fast forward I'm 12 years old and the morality police in Iran wanted to take me to jail because a strand of my hair was visible through the hijab waa my mom begged for my life and saved my life excuse me shortly after we decided to leave Iran my parents left everything and we immigrated to the United States because they wanted to give me a better life and better opportunity I went to school here I got my degree in chemistry I have a Jed and NBA I worked for Pharma and medical devices for years but there was something missing in me and it was the desire that I always had because my dad in Iran did something that that improved people's lives and before my dad died I told them that I want to I want to do something better and in however small a way the VC does that it helps people live a healthier life and have more fun cycling and if I can do do it a woman an immigrant anybody can this dream is the American dream come true now did you get your patent or is it still pending not only one we have six patents six patents are they utility and design utility and design Annie do you have your own money into this we invested our own savings into how much money do you have in $500,000 together wow the big chains carry maybe five or six different seats cuz the bike shop business is where a lot of this happens and this is the retrofit Market you're servicing now I already own the bike I'm going to swap out my seat but there's a massive Market of bikes being created every day with new seats on them you can't get that market unless you get distribution unless you OEM it yeah why don't they license it I'm getting there which way do you want to go do you want to sell it yourself to the store or go to the manufacturer now that already has has the distribution cuz you have the patents and cut a license deal have you done that Annie no we have not done that yet why why why with a new product this and a new design that's coming out to the market we have to be on the front lines talking to our customers and telling them that this is going to work and what about going to a manufacturer are you against that or you for it we're not against that no can this become a big business direct to consumer or is the only path here to get to scale to we am at with bikes and get them to put it on I think we can do both absolutely I have a company Shark Tank Company Guardian bikes and they have short stop technology you don't go over the handle bars and when we first started working together I thought perfect sense let's OEM because every manufacturer is going to want to improve the safety of their bike and not even close the margins on bikes are razor thin they wouldn't even entertain adding any type of cost to the bike I don't think the market is as big as we think it is for those Reasons I'm out there's a lot of work here particularly if you want to do the OEM deal it's a long long process but because you have patents you may want to go down that Journey I'll do the 150 for 20% thank you for that offer any I'm the sporty shark you two are the real deal thank you I love your background you may know my dad escaped the communist country we came here with nothing on a bicycle on a bicycle but I think the one thing they always make fun of me but I think the one thing as an immigrant I'm grateful for the opportunity in this country absolutely honestly every day I wake up grateful and then there's people Kevin who are not grateful that's a crazy offer it's better than no offer here's my offer look there is a lot of work with this you've convinced me the path is direct to Consumer for the next 2 to 3 years I think if it works the manufacturers will come to us I'll give you the 150,000 for 15% I think that's a fair valuation that's my offer guys I have to tell you I think what works against it it doesn't look comfortable and I think that's going to be a hard sell I'm worried about that but I do wish you luck and I am out I think it's amazing that You' have gotten many patents that the two of you put your minds together and there's nothing more fun than knowing that you've created something that will make the world a better place and bring people Joy but you have two great offers here I will let you pay attention and focus on them and I'll go out Annie I made you a better offer than Kevin should I take my offer up to a better offer should I go up to 20% than you Robert will you consider 12 and a half% % I will not I already I think made a better offer than Kevin I feel that's a fair valuation I'm going to stick at 15% the only thing better than one shark is two sharks would you guys in order to do in order to do that even if we were to consider it I don't get out of bed for less than 10% I'll go in with Kevin on it but I think for two of us it would have to be 25% for 150,000 do that deal would you do that deal for double the money not double no Robert what about giving him 200k for 25 I do that deal can we talk to each other for I would wait too long on that than you yes got thank you abolutely incredible thank you much the reason I want it is I'm going to use it good design thank you congrats guys good luck my God God we got it my God this is amazing is is is taken the American dream to the N level this is I I did not expect this much success and these results when we started this journey it's amazing for\n\nNLP

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nFirst into the Shark Tank are Sarah Pawn and Mike Hartwick who believe they're on the cusp of the next big fitness craze. [Music] Hi Sharks. I'm Mike Hartwick and I'm Sarah Pon and we're here to present our company Surfset Fitness. We are seeking $150,000 for 10% equity in our company. Surfset Fitness is surf inspired exercise equipment and group fitness classes. This is the Rip Surfer X. It's the world's first total body surf trainer. We've designed it to mimic the instability of a surfboard on water. And we have here with us Lakey Peterson. She's one of the top 10 female surfers in the world. And she's here to show you a few of her moves. Leaky is going to walk through the popup. This is one of our moves in Surf Set. It's extremely challenging. It's an athletic move. She's going to use her arms, her core, balance, stability. You can see she's rocking side to side. All about the imbalance. Now she's going to show you how a surfer would dive under a wave. This is called a duck dive. You can see she's engaging her triceps, her chest, working the arms, the core, and we're going to finish with what we call a water walker. , it's similar to a one-legged squat. You can see she's trembling a little bit. She's engaging every muscle in her core, her legs. , we're here today, Sharks, because we have more interest in orders than we can handle, and we need your help. That looks it's hard for the average person to do any of those exercises. That's complex. It's difficult to stay stabilized. Let's take an average bozo Robert. Absolutely. Only thing we ask is your shoes off. Get the full experience if you can. She made it look pretty easy. It didn't look that hard. I got to be honest. , she's had some experience. , we get up one foot at a time. All . I'll step on. There you go. And then bend the knees. Get into your carve and your surfing motion. Look at him. Whoa. Nicely done. [Music] What was the hard move? Was it the one foot? Yeah. You go one leg and then you go that as if you're stroking through the water with your skateboard. That's a little harder. yeah, you got to find that middle. It's a little gets a little shaky on that one. There you go. Good night, Robert. That was good. Thanks. How do you change the the levels? You can change it quickly. you want to make this hard, snap these off and it goes that. That makes it harder. You can take all three off. And are those on both sides? Yes. What happens if you weigh 300 lb? Can you still use it? 450 weight tested. , I got to tell you, I'm a little tired. See? Yeah. How'd you come up with the idea? This guy will tell you. , I was was professional hockey player and I've been a lifelong surfer. As I was getting towards the end of my career, I decided, , I want to surf a little bit more. And every time that I spent more time in the ocean, I was I felt better on my skates. I I performed better. I had better seasons. And I found then that there is a tie between fitness and surfing. We made $150,000 in 4 months running classes. , we took it to New York. our 11 machines. We set up in a a large gym there. Believe it or not, it media windfall. We've had celebrities on the park, Good Morning America, Access Hollywood. We had people paying $35 a class, sold out classes for the entire 4 months. I'm getting more interested. How much is this unit retailing for? $400. And your cost? 150. You're going to have to get this down to $100 for it to retail at 400. , it's not a problem. Who's running the show here on the business side? That's a good question. , , when I went to Europe, I got my MBA. Tried it in finance for a little bit. You tried finance, you said? Yeah, I was in finance. , do you think there's anything odd about valuing this company at $1.5 million? , no. We've also had 200 inquiries for franchising to open private studio. , you're coming here for not only our money, but our strategic assistance, but you're only offering us 10%. Why would you offer us little? It might be little now, but that 10% of a large company is for the company that we have to work for. We don't want you guys to work for us. We want to work for for you in a sense. We want you to be able to make a phone call and we want to show up. How much do you think those phone calls cost? A lot. It took me 20 years kissing a lot of butts to get some of those people on my That's why we value it highly. I'm going to make you an offer because I think that this is a great idea. You could go out there and hire professional surfers to be your certifiers and trainers, which would give you a lot of authentication. Because of that, I think you're going to need more than $150,000 in cash to do it . And in order to make an investment in this, I have to have enough skin in the game. , what I'm going to do is offer you $300,000 for 33%. what what what happened there is he knocked the value down from a million and a half to 900,000. But I put in you a position to get out there and not have to stress about how much cash you have for inventory and to not stress about hearing these guys nickel and dime. You got nickel and dime for 33% now. It's an interesting offer, Mike. I see the business a little bit differently. I think you don't need the professional surfer guys. I think they're great, but I think that can be intimidating to a lot of people. The trainers need to be bubbly, energetic. I'll give you the 150,000 because I don't think you should give up that much equity. It's going to go big for 20%. , a lower valuation is what you're saying. I'm saying keep more equity. Nobody starts a company out of their basement and works their butt off to give up one-third of it at this stage. Don't gamble your future until what you have. A lower valuation for less. Funny, every time I say something, I hear somebody else talking. That always happens. It's a shadow. That's always happening to you. It's a mini me. I have a an offer as . I own many CrossFit gyms, I understand that lifestyle and the culture. I'm willing to give 150 but unlimited manufacturing of the boards, 25%. For free. You're going to give them the boards for free. But I give you the cash, ? you you have you're a finance guy. That's why I'm not messing around. Yeah, but when you go through that C when you go through that cash, you still have to put it back in. You have to put it back in. I'm giving you cash and then I'll manufacture the boards. Sarah, Mike, what are you going to do? [Music] All five sharks are still in and Sarah and Mike have three offers on the table. Keep an eye on one thing here as these offers come in because it matters. You started with a million and a half ask for the value of what you've created here. Mark knocked you down 33% to 900,000. These two greedy sharks have knocked you down half of what you asked for. Also, manufacturing is is a plus. That's factoring. It's factoring. Mike, you're going to have the money . It's not factoring. It's not at all. You're going to want to do apparel. You're going to want to do board shorts. You're going to want to do a bunch of things. No, you're not. No, you're not. Get them in. Then they're already selling a lifestyle, Robert. No, no, but not at the beginning. The The way they're going to fail is by doing too many things at once. I think they don't need to do too many things at once if they have me on that side. what? I Damon's better. I the apparel thing. I think I want a piece of your deal. I want to stop you there. I it better than Mark's. I want to give you a word of caution. The best guy for you on this deal is Mark Cuban. Smart lady. What? That's ridiculous. Why? You're honest. You say it it is. And you want to do something? No. You be quiet, please. Mark's that way. He's much richer than you, but he's cut out of the same cloth. now, what I'm going to offer you is to take half of Mark's position out. Barbara, why don't you suck up to everybody up here? Because I'm And it's totally up to Mark. The reason you should listen is nobody builds a faster, more -run sales network than I do. I , that is absolute crap. Mike, , come on, Mike. I started a company 9 years ago, three guys. We're 160 people today and 100 million in sales. We did 52 million last quarter. This is what this is. You've got a great plan. You got to execute. I rolled out six CrossFit gyms in the last four months, as as a big training program. And if anything about CrossFit, it's hard to get certified. Yes, but he's a short man and that doesn't fit your image at all. Wow. Barbara. , Mark, are you in or are you out with Barbara? Sorry, Barbara. I don't need you on this one. I'm going alone. , in that case, I'm out. Do you want more money than 150,000 today? I think that we could that we could benefit from more money. now, if we had more, we could do it faster. If you have a manufacturing pipeline, you don't need more money. When a business is on the fast track, one of the biggest challenges they have is to keep up with success because they don't have enough cash available to them to meet demand and then somebody else steps in to meet that demand. And the quicker you get to the point you need to preempt those competitors, the more successful you're going to be. Let me throw in here for a second because I'm listening to all this and I'm saying to myself, you're either going to execute and make this huge because I believe you have the potential and brand is a big part of it for real lasting value. It's not that device, it's the brand you're going to create. The number one guy to build a brand here is this guy. , I want to tack on to his deal. I'll bring you in on the deal. Yeah, I'd to do that because they have to. Yeah. And this is where my 24 secondond shot clock comes in because I need a decision. $300,000 in cash for a third. We'll partner. Should you need more because business explodes, there's more money there. I don't think you need to give up one/ird of your business today. I think that would be foolish. And I don't think you guys are foolish. That's way too much. Mike, I'm giving you 150,000 for 20%. Barbara's out. Damon and Kevin are 150,000 for 25% and they're giving manufacturing. Mark Cuban is in at 300,000 but he's stealing onethird of your company today. What's your what's your preference? Let's go with your feeling. manufacturing brand is important for us. Sarah Mike, what are you going to do? Is there any way to come down on any of that? Little bit. Talk to me. Yeah, a little bit. Little bit on the ownership. I'll come down to 30% if you say yes now. No, don't do it. A designer alone is going to cost you 150. Push, Sarah. the thing to do here. Mark, we're going to accept your offer. That's what I'm talking about. Horrible deal. Congratulations. We're going to make a lot of money. We're going to make a lot of money. You made yourself millionaires. Absolutely.

Let's be real, hair removal sucks. It's a tedious task that we have to do over and over again. As a hairy brown girl with sensitive skin, I've left many waxing salons with less hair, but my skin my skin was collateral damage. Wall Shark's hair removal has never been sweeter. . Say hello to Sugar Dough. At home sugaring kits to remove any hair. We to say we got your back and your front, arms, legs, and anywhere else. Made with sugar, water, and citrus, our all natural sugar-based dough gently pulls hair from the root while exfoliating your skin, leaving feeling silky smooth. And it's a gentle, compostable alternative to waxing. , Sharks, I'm the sugar mama to sugar dough, I'm asking for some serious dough. I'm seeking $500,000 for 5% of the company. Wow. But first, come on, Kendra. My friend Rishot here is in need of some sugaring himself. Do you want to come up and be his sugar mama and sugar with me? I do. I get to remove. my gosh, this is exciting. Kevin's back. Baker do. Kevin's back. Yes, I know. Are you serious? This is my dream come true. , sugar dough is made with this taffy goop and it is fun to play with. It's similar to caramel or taffy. Made with similar ingredients as . . What do I do? , you can try on this side. . , all . Tell me if I'm doing this . . I'm going to mold it into your skin. I'm going to help I'm going to let it heat up a minute. Exactly. And I'm going to help it. And then you want to pull taut with the other hand. , pull the skin taut and then three, two, one. my god. You did a good job, Kendra. That's satisfying. Awesome. I'm going to dismiss Resot. Thank you much. Good job, buddy. Try to wrap my head around the 500,000 5% 10 million valuation. This innovation is ancient. It was found in Phoenician times. Women have been using it forever. Yes. All through the Mediterranean. Yes. And there's zero proprietary elements to it. Anybody can do this. help me, help me, help me get to $10 million. We've worked two years to create a proprietary manufacturing process and also our own formulation. that's where we have some of our own IP to be able to you do your process is the IP. Yes. Exactly. now would be a good time to tell us a little about sales. Sales. Yes. Sales. Sales. I would love to tell you about our sales. I launched in September 2020 as a solo entrepreneur and at that point at the end of the year I made 50k in revenue. Got it. Fast forward to 2021 we went viral on Tik Tok and we made $2.6 million in sales. From 50,000 to 2.6 50,000 to 2.6. That's what I'm talking about. And then last year we ended the year in $5.6 million in sales. Wow. , we first started in D TOC and then we grew to Amazon and then at the end of 2022 we made it in 300 Ulta beauty stores. Last year we expanded full nationwide and into 1300 stores and that's where we had that big bump in sales. Did you make money on the 5.6? No, we didn't make money. How's that possible? We didn't make money. in order to make profits in retail, we learned the hard way that you need 85 90% margins. Our margins were around 60%. However, this year we updated our suppliers and we implemented our manufacturing process and our margins are now hovering around 80%. Did you lose money or? Yes, we lost money last year. How much did you lose? We ended the year at 777%. you lost $440ome,000. How did you fund all those losses? Me and my husband invested $400,000 of our personal money. But you lost more. You lost 400. then that's that goes into our debt that we have now. How much debt do you have? We have $1.5 million. Hello. There we go. Yeah. We also have $1 million in inventory. But it also means that you have no cash now. We have no cash now. That's why I'm here in the Shark Tank. Yeah. That is what you need. That is what I need now. Yeah. Especially if we want to get into more retailers. You can't afford to go into more retailers. We have debt financing which is at a high interest rate of 22%. Wow. Hello. That means where it is. your total debt is 1.5. Yeah. That's what's killing us now is because 20% of the money that we borrow is out the door. We had all this money tied up in inventory and now we're sizing. much has changed in the last few months. Going through hyperrowth you did. Yeah. Is hard. Yes. borrowing money to get there put you even further underwater because you're always it feels you can never catch up and and get even . Yeah. I wish I had a way where I could say here you go. This is the approach. But I thought when I walked in and saw it I thought this was food and I got hungry. I don't know this stuff at all. for those reasons I'm out. But I wish you the best. . Thank you Mark. I appreciate it. The ask is too big without even fighting about the valuation. I would never value this at 10 million now. You've got sales. I that. But you got a long way to go. It It's, , if you'd come in here for 100, 150, even 200, maybe I take the ride, change the valuation a bit, but this is nuts. I think it's nuts. , for that reason, I'm out. Thank you, Kevin. Yeah. , it's hard because you couldn't predict that you were going to go this high and then as soon as you got that that level, , you had to learn what you didn't know, ? the the amount of margin on these things and then you got to borrow money against it. You can't leave Ultra empty-handed when they asking for goods. Yeah. But , to give you $500,000 for 5% you would have to distribute $10 million. if you going if you're doing , that's to get your money back. If you to get my money back, that means you probably would have to do in this model $50 million. You'd be older than the Phoenetians that invented this by the time you got your money back. I'm out. Thank you much, Aaliyah. You're amazing, by the way. And I, , as you were talking, I've been there. , I made some of these same mistakes. I did my business on a line of credit. I was bootstrapping everything. I had credit card debt. , I it was hard to get anybody to invest in me, ? I know how what that feels . But what you're accomplishing is , exciting. , you went from 28 to 56. , I love what you're doing. This is not my business and I'm a little worried about the amount of debt that you have. Honestly, , before you say no, I'm willing to make a deal and that's why I'm here. I have worked my butt off for the last four years and grown super fast to be able to get to the point where I'm at now. And I would partnership and you are Sharks. You guys love problems. This is a great problem to solve. Not sure we we don't know if we love problems. We love solving solving problems. Y'all are problem solvers. you wouldn't be here. The 500 that's a big ask and and it's not even going to put even a little bit of damp on what you've already got to deal with, ? It's not going to solve a lot of problems. But I do admire you. I'm out. . Thank you. I appreciate it. One of the things that concerns me truly is the competitive market. And I wish you good luck, but I'm sorry I'm out. . All . Thank you guys much. I appreciate it.

My wife volunttoled me for this position. That's . And today we're seeking $250,000 for a 10% stake in our company. Sharks. We're revolutionizing the way that you wear your clothing. At 1920, we've created multiunctional convertible clothing perfect for everyday life. At first glance, it may look I'm wearing an extra cozy, super stylish puffer jacket. Give it up for my amazing wife. Woo! But it converts into much more. Check this out. At an outdoor concert and in need of a blanket, simply unzip the bottom of the jacket and voila, you have a blanket. Or at the airport facing excess baggage fees, no problem. This blanket converts into a tote bag. And this tote bag can carry up to 40 lb. Dang. Perfect for my lovely wife who has no idea what the words pack light mean. It's true. I don't. Our jackets are perfect for much more other than travel. Take it to the farmers market, the gym, the laundry mat, and you have an instant bag without needing to give up the warmth of your jacket. Our windbreers also have convenient convertible features. That's , Sharks. This windbreaker has a convertible hood. When you zip it off and you zip the sides together, it turns into a cross body bag. Get hot during the day? Simply take your jacket off? Place it inside of your cross body bag. And now you have a travel pillow. Our convertible clothing adapts to your busy lifestyle instead of you needing to adapt to it. Sharks, who's ready to invest in the only jacket you'll ever need with 1920? That's pretty clever. That's clever. Is your background in design? My background is not in design. I have a background in supply chain. I was a logistics officer in the army for nine years. You were? Yes. That's Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. It's heavy. Yes. we've completely funded the company by ourselves. I look good. Your legs are good. You look amazing. What is that? Is that camouflage? Is that is that supposed to be camouflage? Yes. that's an orange camo design. And each of you sharks have If I saw that in the forest, I'd shoot it. You can't see me now. Zachary, what is your background? , my background, I work working for a major US airline in a variety of roles operationally and customer focused. We make the perfect team because Ashley does 90% of everything and I'm the 10% of handling our operations, fulfillment, and ensuring that our customers have the highest level of service. Direct to consumer direct to consumer. And what would this retail for? that one there retails for $298. $298. What does it cost you? It cost us anywhere from 65 to $70. How do people know about exactly? we have are viral on social media. Our first video that we posted of this jacket was in New York City and it got 66 million views. 66 million. Do you have sales? we started December 2022. that was our first month of selling. We did $78,000 in sales. All of 2023, 269,000 and year to date, we're at 157,000. about $55,000 lifetime sales. There's a disconnect. 78,000 one month. 66 million. had a big breakout in social media. What it's production limitations, ? we fund every single batch that we do and we were not able to fund anymore. We've only done maybe four drops. you do one drop per quarter pretty. That's all we can afford. One drop per quarter. But you take the money that you make from each sale and you roll it back in every time. That's good. And that causes us to be behind though. Do you sell every drop out? Every drop we sell out. Are you profitable? Yes, we are profitable. , out of the $55,000 of lifetimes sales, we have we've made $97,000. Wait a second. What about this year? We're projecting $750,000. Ashley, if you do the 750 in sales, which is geometric growth, and I hope that happens. How much free cash will you make off that? , out of that amount, we are projected to do around $350,000 in net benefit. , with us being able to go ahead and order now, have you paid yourselves anything in that? We do not pay ourselves. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. No, we have not paid ourselves a dollar. , guys, the numbers aren't adding up. If you had made $97,000 and you're not paying yourselves anything, you should be able to buy a good thousand units, ? Where did the money go? That's what I can't figure. , the money has went into R&D. It's went into our patents, ? Because I , then you didn't make $97,000 of profit. You might have made $97,000 in gross margin dollars, ? If you made $97,000 in profit, you would have cash. A good portion of our profit has gone into shipping. We've spent upwards of $15,000 to ship. But guys, you made a comment that is telling. First you said you made $97,000 in profit and then you said $15,000 of your profit went to shipping. The shipping comes before your profit is calculated, ? The number is after you include all your costs. That's where your profit comes from. One of the biggest challenges is fully understanding accounting and managing your cash flow. Because you want to say here that you've made $97,000 because it sounds good, but in reality you didn't make more than 82 and it's probably a lot less than that, ? When you calculate everything. I wouldn't say that we work with financial consultants. , then you have to better understand it, but you have to connect with somebody that can walk you through you understand the impact on your business because you guys don't have that in place now. For those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mark. , you've you've mastered social media, it sounds , cuz you're only selling direct. Have you calculated your customer acquisition cost? It's zero. Yeah. , we do no paid media whatsoever for paid media. Yeah. We have not spent $1 in paid advertising at all, but it's been something that we say, Hey, when we get this money in, we want to take it to purchase more inventory to be You guys are interesting situation because it's not a full-time gig. It's a product turning into a brand, but you're not 100% committed because you've got other jobs. , I wouldn't say that. Up until this point, I think I Ashley and Zachary, I have to say I disagree with both these guys strongly. You guys have earned the to be on their carpet. The only reason why I'm sad that I'm not moving forward is because of the competitive environment, I have to tell you that that I'm out, but don't give up because you're going to do great. Thank you. Thank you, Daniel. And I and I will say that from the outside looking in, I have supported my wife and watched her every single day work 10 to 12 hours and then go work 6 to 8 hours every single night on her business to do everything possible. But I think that's great except I'd rather have her working 25 hours a day for me as an investor. , I I also think that's crap and it's unfair. , I started my first business. I didn't know if it was going to work. I had to work a full-time job for 6 months. The more See, Kevin doesn't understand these things. , wait a second. To say doesn't even matter. No, look, it's my money. I want to You're asking me for 250,000. I'm looking at it this way saying none of my CEOs have part-time jobs. They work 100% of the time for the business. % of the time, but they don't work as much as I do. Boom. I'm tired of the kumbaya stuff and how hard you work and all that. This is real business. , two sharks are out. Kevin is concerned that Ashley and Zachary are not full-time on their convertible coat business 1920. This business has potential because it has zero customer acquisition costs. I that a lot. I'll give you the 250,000 for 30%, but you're quitting your job and you're going to work 110% for this business. Thank you for your offer. we will consider it. No one's more focused than me. The reason my wife is working is because I initially went to do pilot training. And I my dream, my lifelong dream is to become an airline pilot. And while it was going through pilot training, she started her business to help supplement our income. And the business blew up further than we could ever imagine. And it came to a point where the decision was being made, am I going to continue to work hard to support Zach in this endeavor? or am I going to go full into the business and focus on that alone? And I was , I'm not going to let you make that decision. , I went back to work and put my dream on hold that she could I'm telling you, if you make the decision to invest, Ashley is the most scrappy, the hardest working person you will ever have and the most loving. You guys are a team. You do what you do to get the business going. If that means working a job or two jobs and working 24 hours a day, you do it. I can list the 20 problems you have with your business and there's probably 40 things you need to learn more about your business, but there's magic. You strike me at the people that you're going to figure it out. I'd love to be in business with you cuz I think you're going to succeed and I think I can help you. I will give you the 250,000. I want 25% of the business. That's my offer. Thank you much, Robert. Thank you. Are you willing to do 250,000 for 20%. I'm going to stick at 25%. You've got the other offer at 30. The only thing I'm thinking is we love Robert and I'm thinking I You don't love him enough. It sounds I I wish my mom would be able to see this. , Ashley's mom passed when she was only eight years old. And Ashley and I, we're high school sweethearts, and we've climbed to where we are now together. We've started in retail. We've moved into corporate roles. We You're doing amazing. We've we've we've been ultimately scrappy. And to be here is a dream. Honestly, it's a dream. , people always I didn't have a lot growing up, but I had a mom who believed in me no matter what. And that made me believe in me when nobody else in the world ever did. That's why I'm sitting here. And you have that belief. and you've got an incredible partner, your incredible team, and you can build on that confidence and sit in this chair one day. Why are we squabbbling about 5%. We're not 250,000 25%. Let's build something great. We'll take it. Boom. Congrats, guys. done. Great job. Thank you much. Thank you much. Thank you. Good job. Don't listen to him. Thank you.

I am from Portland, Oregon, and I am seeking $100,000 in exchange for 20% equity in my company. Sharks. The world has been through a lot of big changes these past few years. A big pandemic, a big recession. In fact, all of our problems have gotten too dang big. We need more cute in the world. It's time to think small. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. That's what I'm talking about. Introducing Mini Materials. Authentic, highquality, modern miniature building supplies for dollhouse construction, diaramas, and two-scale recreations. We deliver joy by the pallet load. We use innovative techniques to bring high-quality products that are made in the USA. And they are as real as they are adorable. A real concrete, real wood, even real metal. Traditional dollhouse companies do Victorian molding. We do brief blocks. They do picket fences. We do jersey barriers. They do doilies and frills. We do moving dollies and pallet jackets. That's pretty good. We are not your grandmother's dollhouse company. We cater to a new generation of creatives who make art with fingerboards and action figures and RC crawlers. If your hobby is small, then we are the perfect fit. Now, Sharks, we don't to make guarantees about gains, but after one day with many materials, you will be able to lift an entire pallet of cinder blocks over your head with one hand. , Sharks, who wants to demolish a stagnant industry and make a big deal with many materials? That's great. Good job. Good job. Bravo. Why? Why does anybody need any of this? It's a toy. What are you talking about? Because people need joy. And everybody has some samples in front of them if you guys want to start playing. I'm here to answer questions when you're done playing with. , that's from someone who has had to wrap a lot of pallets. This is adorable. Thank you. When you said this is real concrete. Yeah. This is real. Yes. It's mortar. It's mortar. Yeah. cute. Look, even a little buzz sock. 15 years, never seen anything this. Super cute. How does it translate into sales? Give us an idea of when you started this and what occurred. I bought the business one year and one month ago. , . , the business has a lot to do with Reddit with the online form Reddit. Yeah. One of the original co-founders was looking on Reddit and somebody had handmade a concrete block and they were , \"That is awesome.\" And he started making them and then he put it on Reddit as saying look I have this whole pallet with cinder blocks and people were I love that. Went to the front page of our went to the front page of Reddit again. Dang. lo and behold pretty soon they had a healthy side business. I came across this post. Hey I have a business and I'm looking to sell it. I reached out via Reddit and ended up purchasing the company from them. What did you buy the business for? 200,000. And where did you get the money for that Jared? I took heliloc against my house. wow you you went all in. I did. I have been always wanting to start a business. What attracted me to this is it's making things. And what what are your margins on this? on an individual product basis they go from 50 to 93% with blended rate of about 75%. that's not bad at all. What are your sales? in the last year I've done $200,000 in sales. Good for you. Yeah. And you own it 100%. And you're making them? I make them. Yeah. How much does this sell for? , that one without the logo printed on it is $20. And what does it cost you to make this? $4. That's pretty pricey. , this is for enthusiasts or hobbyists that are probably a little more mature. Is this for children? ? , I'm trying to get the the the age 8 to 12 is what my packaging guidelines recommend. What's the average? I don't know if I have a hard number on that that I would be 100% confident in saying I I do know generally. generally what do you see on let's talk social media is that answer my question. because he doesn't know his demographic in that reason I'm out. what do you do with social media? I could see this doing a lot of stop action animation and stop animation. People do stop animation with things for sure. But are you doing any of that to increase sales? I am. But one of the reasons I'm here now is marketing is my biggest weakness as a company. I'm not horrible at it. Tell us about your background. I'm doing this full-time now. I grew up in rural Idaho, went to a two- room schoolhouse. and then after I graduated, I moved to Portland. I blinked and got up my first real professional job. Blinked and then was married. Blinked and had kids. Blinked and had a house. And life was flying by. And this desire to start a business was always there, but starting a business and not having sales seemed slightly irresponsible for having kids and having a mortgage. I love how you said that. , I blinked and 15 years later, two words have never been broken. Yeah. Life goes, \"You have a business.\" Are you making money on the 200,000? I am making money. Yes. Are you paying yourself? How much? I am paying myself. , far in that last year and a month, I have pulled out about 55,000 out of the business. Good for you. Good for you. , it's it's interesting. I can see a forever perpetual demand for it from a small segment of the market. Everything about it is small, . Yeah. And and that makes it a difficult investment for me cuz , I don't know how you blow this thing up. It's too small for me. Jared, I'm out. I'm sorry to hear that. I do think there is a lot of good upside. I think it's cute as can be. It's not a business for me, but I think it's a great business for you, and I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Thank you, Jared. I blinked and I've been here for 15 years. , what I've learned is if you have a good business, you can get it to 2 to 3 million by sheer willpower of your execution. You can make a fantastic living, but as an investor, I need to see more scale. I don't see it beyond that. , I'm going to be out for that. wish you all the best. I think there is upwards of room for Jared entrepreneurs are willing to take the pain of working working to avoid the pain of looking back when you're 70 80 90 years old and never had tried. Yes. And you get a ton of credit for going for it. I think this business can be successful, but because it's new in inventing a new industry in a lot of respects, it could take decades, ? And I know that you don't want to hear that sound of it. That's a lot of pain. But I I I'm not ready to go along for that long a ride. , for those reasons, I'm out. Everybody loves the product. Love it. You got to grind it out. Jared, it is cool. Jared, you have something here. And it'll never happen fast enough, but when you blink again, it could be a two, three, four million dollar business with a million dollars in your pocket. Yeah. All , man. Good luck for Thank you guys.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Jared Waters, Sharks, Jared (PERSON), Portland, Oregon, USA, Reddit, Idaho (GPE), 20%, 50 to 93%, about 75%, 100% (PERCENT), Victorian (NORP), RC (PRODUCT), Reddit (ORG), first (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** a lot, a business, the business, the world, many materials, cinder blocks, good job, you guys\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 introduce: Mini Materials\n  \u2022 deliver: joy\n  \u2022 use: techniques\n  \u2022 do: molding\n  \u2022 do: blocks\n  \u2022 do: picket fences\n  \u2022 do: jersey barriers\n  \u2022 do: doilies\n  \u2022 make: guarantees\n  \u2022 need: any\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.24)\n\n**Topics:** business, year, jared, lot, reddit",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nHi Sharks. I'm Mona Weiss and I'm Scott Shields and our company is Econuts. We are seeking 175,000 for a 15% stake in our company. Econuts is a line of eco-friendly cleaning products packaged with little to no plastic. Now, I know what you're thinking. , it's another green cleaning company. But Econuts are totally different. Most of our products are certified organic and are based on this. This is our secret weapon. It's an organic berry from the Himalayas that naturally produces a soap. It's called a soap berry or soap nut, thus our name, Ecouts. You can use these berries for laundry by placing four to five of them. Place them in the wash bag directly in your machine. When it comes in contact with the water, it releases a natural soap as it gets shaken around, which can do your laundry. This jar of water is going to represent your washing machine. I'm going to place in one [Music] It makes soap. Isn't that cool? , you can It It's still solid. , it does. You can reuse these up to 10 times. , this box here does a year's worth of laundry and it replaces 10 bottles of detergent. And now is the perfect time to invest. Americans spend over $70 billion a year on cleaning products. And with your help, we can help take a bite out of it and help save the planet. What do you say, Sharks? You with us? , why is it the perfect time to invest? , we were first to the mainstream market and now we are going to be everywhere. We've managed to capture about 90% of the soapberry market thus far by branding. market there is a soapberry market out there. What percentage? of 90% in less than three years. How big is the soap berry market? How big is it annually? It's in the US it's around about a million dollars. you have $900,000 in sales. No, I walked into that one, didn't I? Let's do the math. Yeah. Yeah. I caught you with your mouth open. I got it. Let's Why don't you put one of those soap berries in your mouth now? Can we Can we go back to Scott's point of 90% market share? How much does that equate to in terms of sales? 90% market share for us. What it equates to is last year we did about $100,000. This year we're already on track to do over 250,000. Can I see a sample? Why yes, absolutely for your idea. I love Mona. Mona is the champ. Are these the nuts? Yes. Thank you, Mona. Are the two of you married? Not yet. We're working. We're engaged. You are. Congratulations. , don't congratulate me. We've been engaged for 5 years. Mona, Mona, let me ask you. Why does a guy stay engaged for 5 years? Why would he do that? We're not using the investment money to get married, but we need to bring our business to the next level that we can get married. Let's say this market takes off. You're assuming your brand, Econuts, will maintain its dominance. , first of all, we have a proprietary sterilization process. And we came up with this because while he and I were in our living room originally sorting berries and we had people who were helping us out sorting berries, we were all getting sick and we we decided that there must be something going on with these. we sent them off to a lab and we found they had stuff on stuff on nuts. Imagine that. you had to get your nuts sterilized. They had monkeys. Everybody needs their nuts sterilized. And if you look into if you look into trying different sterilization practices you'll find it's difficult to get one that is for organic. I'm going to ask you an important question. You have 90% of the market. You say you you've done about 250. You're asking for a little over a million valuation. Uhhuh. Give me the valuation why you came up with is based on the fact that every year we've been in business, we've doubled and tripled our sales. We started our company with $1,000. Now we didn't put any more money into it for over a year. We made $10,000. Our next year we made $40,000 and we saw the business was going somewhere we put it. We're still not making any money. We've we've done over a h 100,000 this year already. How did you secure your customer base? , I'm a social media ninja. , we've got more fans on Facebook than you do, Barbara. , I'm insulted and I'm out. There you go. , no. Don't be out yet. I'm only kidding. No, no, no. Look at that. The market is small now and what you've got a million dollars of sales in the US means a tremendous amount of education has to occur before people that do laundry are going to start buying nuts. It's going to be a tough haul. I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm not saying you're not the best. It's that your company today is not worth over a million dollars. It isn't. You're not making enough money yet. You're not even married yet. For 175,000 I probably have to own all of this company now. I'm out. , you say you're number one in the market. I'm trying to understand this. Shouldn't have said that, Scott. . You said that the market is a million dollars. It's not a million dollars. He messed up. How do you not know the numbers, guy? . He Hold on, Robert. Robert, you shouldn't be making these mistakes and these assumptions. I'm out. , who do we have left here? Robert, you got to know the numbers. You can't come out and say, I own 90% of the market, and it turns out you might own 10%, 15%. I would to get into this business because I do think it's going to grow at 175,000. What possible offer could I give you that's reasonable from a pure numbers perspective? It's It's not a $1.2 $2 million business today. 175,000 for 50%. Would you consider that? I'd consider, but I wouldn't take it unfortunately. , from what we You better be working 16 hours a day on our business we do. Sorry, what did you say? I said you better be working 16 hours a day on our business we do for that money. , no. I work 24 hours a day in my business I could have the privilege of sitting up here and listening to people you. I'm out. , guys. I'll get to the point. I think your marketing is horrible. There's nothing that's going to demonstrate to me that your product is any different than the others. You're using berries to do your clothes. We sterilize ours. But that's the point. You may sterilize them, but there's nothing there that tells me that you do that. , you've completely left out your greatest differentiation. , the branding and the look of the boxes alone, when you look at how traditionally in the marketplace, when I look at the boxes, I'm going to know they're sterilized nuts at our size advertising out there in front of everybody. , look, here's this, here's that, here's the what we do differently until we're large enough to truly have our giving me excuses. I'm giving you a solid and valid reason of how we've managed to protect ourselves in business run rabid with dogs and managed to climb our way up to be number one. Congratulations be brought down. what? When you're done patting yourself on the back, you should look at your marketing and say the message this big board sends me is not going to educate me on the fact that you have a differentiated product product. You've completely left it out and now you've left me out. I'm out. . Hi, Shortcut. , let me tell you the best part about your pitch today is you are such a good couple. It only takes an hour to get married. my lord. I think the Econut's name is great. But beyond that, I don't think you present the product at all. ? I'm out. , thank you. , thank you much for letting us show everything. Wait, wait a minute. I also agree with Barbara that you did a genuinely terrible job, but she moved me with something she said. And I haven't done this before in Shark Tank, but I'm willing to do it today because I am Mr. Wonderful. Do you want me to marry you now? Can you marry us? Of course I can. I'm Mr. Wonderful. My parents would kill me. I'm sorry then. You leave with nothing. Leave them on the line. All , guys. , good luck.

for a 10% stake in our company and the reality is I was the one who stumbled I was training for my fifth marathon on a dark early morning training run when I hit a pothole that I couldn't see and took a dive I was injured I hobbled home I came through the door and I said honey I need headlights for my sneakers he did say that and he does have a brilliant idea every once in a while the result was Nightrunner 270 Sho lights they provide 270\u00b0 of visibility around you 150 lens out in front with a 30t beam distance to identify any trip hazards that might be in your path night Runners are

Lor C to it would ruin my outfit I'm staying here here you go Kevin thank you there you go with the shoes untied you slip them onto the top row it simply goes under here this close the doors nice you

think you're going to sell this year and next year and how much money you going to make this year with investment would be a 760,000 dollar year and that's 20,000 investment we have enough inventory on hand to do an organic year of about $300,000 you mean you don't have enough money to buy enough inventory to sell more how much do you guys have left we have about 15,000 you're backs up against the wall when I go out biking in the morning I could hardly find a spot on the on the road in Central Park that's how many bikers are out there I rarely see someone running at night and that's a city of 8 million people I mistrust the quantity of people who want to run at night I'm I'm out based on that I I I appreciate that but I would to also mention the night shift there more there is more it's called the night shift is for the occupational safety Market it is for people who work at night it is for construction workers do Road workers out there now no that's not bad though no this is a way anything with Sho anybody who works in the dark that Haso get hit by cars they do that's a little more interesting because I can see broader you put this on a work boot part of the problem is you named it Night Runner and there's your work boots that's why the new model we will be called night shift this is the real game changer we know we can get our feet wet with the athletic Market but the occupational safety Mar why do why can't the existing product do that resources if you're going to work an entire shift you need to last 8 to 10 hours the battery life that's the problem it's yeah the these are meant for over four hours I think you has done a great job I think we can help you with expanding the product line I'll give you the 250,000 for 30% I it too I was thinking I was going to go out but when you showed me the product for the industrial safety and walking Market that got my juices flowing that makes a lot more sense to me if it becomes a standard safety item the mining industry is going to be huge with this the security Market at night that appeals to me I would do this 250,000 for 15% you better grab that away yes I got a question for you you could take Kevin's offer or you could take Robert's offer or you could take what's behind door number two would you be door number three by I don't have to be number three it's door number two you want to ask yourself do I feel lucky do you have an offer Lori 300,000 for 20% I'm going to give you a little bit more money asking a little more Equity I'm not a runner I'm a walker but I love it because it's smart product and that's why I want to be involved with it cuz products what I do wow thank you much I tell you preparing for this opportunity we said gosh every single one of you offer something what a that we need we are our sales are increasing in the southern hemisphere remember you have three offers on the table why are you keeping everybody waiting as you're out of respect stop selling focus on the offers you you have three offers Robert's 250,000 for 30% Lor's 300,000 for 20% and I'm 250,000 for 15% you've got to make a decision hey Doug listen I'm going to change my offer I'll give you 200,000 for 15% because I think that's the cash to buy inventory get the product out on top of that I'll give you 150,000 as a pure loan my total offer is 350,000 in effect for 15% but 150 of it debt I'll throw in an offer to tell you where I'm at it's going to take a lot of work what I'll do is I'll offer you the 250k for 30% but I'll offer you unlimited purchase order financing Mark's going the other way he's back up to the 30% could we have a minute to talk about this absolutely we're not going to go far what do you think these are all good offers Robert obviously is the most in tune with with running it's a lot of work I'm not saying the other ones it for the running Market I it for everything else but Kevin believes in the occupational safety Market that's the highest valuation what about going in all together for the 30% count me I don't even get this product if we're going to do that why don't we go up to 35 or something yeah why don't you why don't we to the last $155,000 guys before before you start while you were away we also talked amongst ourselves one of the risks of leaving the room and that's always a risk in Shark Tank sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad let me explain you've now got two offers across four sharks broken up this way Mark's offer is he's the Lone Wolf now he's going to make you that offer 250,000 for 30% the other three sharks that offer a lot we're going to make the same you're going to get three sharks for the same amount we'll give you the 250,000 for 30% three sharks with all the benefits they have they decided to copy me for obvious reasons but the competition happens we all the deal we we I think we thought you're willing to give up more Equity I'll be honest with you we came in here looking as a 20% being a being a ceiling is there is there any offers that would cap the equity at 20 % not mine not ours you got a lot of work to do if you want the benefit of multiple sharks you got to leave them a little bit of meat on the bone you came back in saying you wanted to do it for 20% and I had offered you 300 for 20% I would do the 250 for 20% you're leaving the team now interesting that's a shk move there's no Unity on the team anymore obviously these alignments can fall out of fa a quickly but I would do this you got to take that now I'll go back to mine I'll do the 250,000 for 15% and Doug what I'll go back to my I will go back to my original offer my original offer 300 for 20 I'll do 350 for 15 I don't believe this it's would you a not Robert is 200,000 for 15% plus 150,000 of debt for your inventory Lori is 300,000 for 20% and I am 250,000 for 15% and Mark is 250,000 for 30% with unlimited financing all what do you guys want to do all first of all thank you much for all of the offers I I want to ask Kevin yeah do you have the same passion for the other markets that you do the occupational safety Market I have a passion to make money you show me the direction you want to put your focus on I'll support you it's you need somebody that knows this Market with you that uses a product I'll do the 250 for 15 and the 100 of it as a loan it doesn't matter you're getting 350,000 in cash don't make an investment with somebody who doesn't understand or use the product that's ridiculous that's a the only time Kevin runs is to lunch I'm a fine-tuned athlete I can kick his ass and squash every day robt let me ask you this yes sir would you go in with Lori at 20% for two sharks I'm in Lori no I'm sorry I think if it were the two of us together we were doing before then you have to be at the 30% then

I'm Ronnie Pritchette and I'm Nancy Pritchette and we're from San Diego, California and we're the married co-founders and co-owners of Triple Light. We're seeking $400,000 for 10% equity in our company. Wow. Our patented technology improves the flex. -. no. It's our luck. The lights would go out when we're getting ready to make our big pitch to the sharks. No. , it's a good thing you have a flashlight, Ron. That's . , that's not too bright, huh, Ron? That's not a flashlight. Now, this is a flashlight. Wow. You're . That is a flashlight. I'm always , Ron. that. Sharks. Since the invention of the flashlight in 1899, the only significant improvement has been the bulb inside. The light may be brighter, but the spill of light is still the same. Why would anyone want to use this ancient thing when they could use the 180\u00b0ree flashlight? Our triple light patented technology shines crisp white LED light and a wide 180\u00b0ree arc. This is thanks to three perfectly positioned LED bulbs that shine an ultra bright light 180\u00b0 wide and 160 ft in front of you. The triple light will light up an entire room, your backyard, or anywhere you need it most. Instantly, helping you feel safe and secure. Now, thanks to the Triple Light, you'll never have to wave your flashlight back and forth ever again. , Char, who wants to join the Triple Light family and help us brighten up our world? Good job, guys. I got to tell you, that was good theater. Guys, tell us about you and how you guys met and how you got into business and all that. , I went to the University of Georgia and a year after I graduated, I married Ronnie. Then, we had two children. I became a stay-at-home mom and when the kids grew up, left the house, Ron came up with this. How long have you two been married? 41 years. Yeah. , congratulations. How long ago did you invent Triple Light? , it was in 2012. I'm walking down the steps in our backyard and I have a traditional flashlight this. As I'm going down the steps, something left caught my eye. I did that to see what it was. , when I did, the steps became dark and almost tripped and I weighed it back. And I thought, why should I have to wave a flashlight back and forth? Why can't I turn on a flashlight and not see straight ahead but left and ? And thus the idea of the triple light 180\u00b0ree flashlight. And were you an inventor in , I'm a golf professional. Golf? , you are? Yeah. Are you serious? I've been a golf professional since 1976. , I knew I had to be the one to get it going because he was selling golf putters to make a living for us, but I had no business experience whatsoever. , I had to start from scratch and I learned everything I could about business, marketing, and sales. What have you sold? Our lifetime sales is at $5 million. Wow. Yeah. Good for you, Nancy. And that technically, he did come up with it in 2012, but it took him 2 years to get the patents and, , get it started, get the prototypes. We launched in 2014, but I want to say we didn't launch until 2020. We've done over $4 million in four years. What did you do last year? Last year we did $1,77,000. And what will you do this year? We're projected to do $1.5 million this year. Wait, there's some there's a disconnect here. you came up with it 2012. You got the patent in 2014, but you don't have sales to 2020. What happened? , we launched in the fall of 2014 and we sold over $100,000 worth of flashlights. In 2015, the sales jumped to five $310,000. And then in 2016, in the first quarter, everything changed. We brought on an investor. We brought brought him on for capital and what we thought mentorship. Then in 2018, January, they sued us for control of our company. Sorry. What? , we fought back and in a few months, August of 2018, they were removed from our company and Nancy and I got our company back 100%. Wow. Yay. Nancy, there's something special about being able to stand up to get your company back. what? I have to tell you, at the time, we trusted people and that was our mistake. I've had it happen to me, too. It happened. what? It's extremely sad. There's a lot of people out there that are wolves. Tell me what is your cost? What is your wholesale? What is your retail? , for the flashlights there in front of you, the TL800, that one landed to $6.50, wholesales for 15, retails for $29.95. . , you did a million last year. You think you'll do 1.5. What will your profits be on that? 318,000 before. Is that before or after paying yourself before? , we don't pay ourselves. . why haven't you gone or been approached by other flashlight companies to get this technology? I look at this and I say why is every flashlight in the world not this? We we were approached by a couple of the big boys. They wanted to pay us a small royalty. We have five utility patents and a design patent in 27 countries around the world. This is selfevident. Every flashlight should be this. That's correct. Look, I I get the whole story. I see the product innovation. I I understand because you're freaked out about control. You've lived through that horrible slime ball, whoever it was, that screwed you out of your company. I don't want control. ? I want you to make every decision after I show it to you. I would to make you an offer that says, \"Look, I'll give you the $400,000. I want 49%.\" , hell no. Excuse me. Do you want to hear the offer? No. And then you march with me into every single retailer in America. Havent they suffered enough? Excuse me. In Shark Tank after 15 years, I deal with everybody. . I am going to introduce you to distributors of the three major major retailers. And we may have to adjust pricing. And you say yes, no. Yes. You are giving them a valuation from less than one times their sales. you are doing a decent amount of money. You have done 5 million in sales. You have 27 countries with patents. You have five utility patents. Are you happy doing what you are doing? The answer to that is yes. But here is the thing. this has been my baby. And I want to I want to stress that a little bit. I didnt have any business experience whatsoever. But I learned and I grew and I I have brought this. I I have brought this to almost $5 million in sales in lifetime sales. , it is not we haven not I had to work hard to get it to this point. But, we are at a point, I will tell you that I have gotten it, I think, as far as I can get it. And I think now I feel I am ready. We need somebody. We need a shark to help us get to the next level because this can go global. This can be a hundred million dollar company a year. I am telling you. Listen, I think there is some magic in you guys. I will give you an offer non-negotiable for 25%. ? I will give you the $400,000 and we will partner with you to help you grow cuz you should have a much bigger size. , great. Wow. It is a good offer. I Ron, Nancy, I think you guys have done a great job. Lots of challenges. I am skeptical. Not about you. That is . I think the product is good in all this time. No ones ispicked it up. I think there is more to the story. What do you want to do? Do you want to close the deal? I am out. Go for it. Trying to come in. Are you ready to She said I love you and and I love you, too. Put your hand here. Excuse me. One shark is out. Ron and Nancy have two offers on the table from Kevin and Daniel for their innovative flashlight company, Triple Light. But Mark and Lori may also be interested. Are you ready to put She said I love you and and I love you too. Put your hand here. Excuse me. Don not let those bandito people over here. You are one of our that are sharks. Hello. Hello. Hello. Would you to hear us? We will do the same deal. 25% but you get two of us. Or one thats going to work extra hard and that is going to put 80. It is not we are going to be sitting on a couch eating bon bons. Same deal as Daniel, but you get two for one. You do not necessarily want to have two sharks in a deal there. A lot of things can go wrong. There is too much divide and conquer. We will carry the way with you. I give you my word. You will be in good hands. . We will try to get you into the major stores Home Depot. I have great relationships with all of them as does Mark. but also to try to license it because why not? You have all these patents. Why not also have a This is the way I see it, guys. 100% everything Lorie said, ? And us, we have worked together on a lot of companies, but when I look at Nancy and I see how emotional you get, this is being a parent where you did all you could to get them through high school and college. It is time for them to go in and you want to be the proud parents that say, \"I started that. I got them through school and now it is a $50 million company.\" That would be our goal, guys. It is your moment. What do you want to do? You got three options. . , my gosh. Would either of you take 20%. Anybody? 20. , honestly, we are worth 25 because we are going to let you We are going to let you relax a little, but stay in a little. We want I can tell I will take that. Ill do it for 20% if you say yes. Now, look, if you want two sharks, I am happy to go in with Daniel. I will I will do the 20% with Daniel for 400,000. my gosh. Daniel, thank you much for your offer. We love you and you were one of our top picks. But Lori and Mark, you have a deal. my god. Congratulations. Thank you much. My pleasure. We are going to make that man rude the day he ever tried to hurt you. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. Thank all of you. Good luck, guys.

New Jersey and we're here seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% of our company Dan and I have been athletes our whole lives but as these bones get older our muscles don't recover as quickly that's for sure that's why I go see this guy for help as a physical therapist I use specific tools and techniques muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation reduce pain and speed up the recovery process yep Dan's worked Wonders on my body but I can't bring him home with me that's why we teamed up to create sore soap the world's first do-it-yourself device made from allnatural analgesic essential oil powered soap it's designed to replicate the same Physical Therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office soap's been around for centuries as a matter of fact muscle scraping has been too we're the first to combine them switch your old boring bar to sore soap 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue Health Plus sore soap smells amazing lathers wonderfully and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged sharks I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up and believe me I haven't felt this good since the '90s tell me which one of you is

anti does smell great yeah the beauty of our product we've Incorporated it into an activity of daily living that everybody does everybody woke up this morning and they shower why not do it in a therapeutic way that promotes soft tissue Health why therapy work the scientific answer is an increased what's called fi blast proliferation which leads to collagen synthesis all that means is it's encouraging tissue remodeling tissue regeneration what is this that's a polycarbonate tool called sore tool pro and what's great about is you could put it in your pocket go for a run you get a cramp you get sore you could use that what is your background guys I grew up playing sports my whole life I found myself in the trainer's room I grew in affinity for the Health Science field got my undergrad in biology then I went and got my doctorate in physical therapy I opened up my own practice David was a patient of mine first then he became a friend and now he's a business partner what's your background a long story short this is the first time in my life that I've felt I've been able to combine all of my loves my passion for sports the way the human body works and design into all these products we're helping people feel better David you were a designer by trade for the last 25 years I've been a graphic designer what do it C for you to make it what do you sell it for and what are your sales year to date Dan yeah our our lifetime sales are 125,000 this last quarter we're having our best quarter yet we're about to get to 70,000 what is your lifetime when did you start we started about 2 years ago what do you sell it for and what does it cost you to make the two bars cuz we sell two at a time and the holder we sell it for $23 and it cost us $852 to make have you you got any wholesale orders yet yep we sell in some physical therapy offices and some Boutique gyms manatt between 15 and 17 that's margin for retail let me make a point about the product category for a second there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think it's going to be challenging to explain this I will use it but as an investor I'm out all even though I think it would do great on some of your and then there's one honestly my neck has been killing me I you watch me

My company is DNA Simple and I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange for 12 and a half% of the company. Sharks. Experts are saying that we are due for a new pandemic, a catastrophic disease that can devastate humanity. And that's why medical research is even more important than ever. And that's where we come in. DNS Simple is looking to make genetic research happen 10 times faster that cures to diseases can be found 10 times faster. And my company is paying you for your saliva samples. It's all anonymous and it happens in four easy steps. Number one, you tell me about yourself in 2 minutes on our DNA simple website. Number two, we match you to a research study that's looking for people you. Number three, we ship you this little tube to your house with a prepaid step. And number four, we give you $50 after you've returned the sample back to us. And you can do this as many times as you can. You heard correctly. We're paying you for spinning in the tube. Normally, it's an extremely expensive and long process for researchers to get enough samples for studies. And our company is making it simple. We pay you for a spit, researchers get the samples they need, and we get paid for making it all happen. It's a win-win for everybody. Now, sharks, who's ready to join me in saving mankind? I will come around and show you what the kits look . Great. Is this one for you? Thanks, Olivia. Let me give Lori hers. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Thank you, sir. You're welcome, Lori. Hopefully, you do match a study and get your $50. Thank you much. Great. You said that you spit into the tube, send it back to you, you will pay that person $50, and they can do it as often as they want. They get matched for a study. Correct. For example, if there are 10 researchers across the US that are looking for someone aged 20 to 45 that fit in a particular profile. No, get it . 20 to 25. 20. In your case, 20 to 25. Yes. And every time you do match, you get a notification that you can participate to the study and then we send you a kit and every time you can get that $50. Olivia, I only get $50 if you can match me to a study. I will send this to you after you've matched the study. . how much are they paying you? Typically, it would go around 155 per. , the research companies are paying you $155 and you're paying $50 of that off the top. Yes. For the sample, correct? Any other cost to you? , the kit, we have we're making the kits inhouse. And what's it cost you to make each one? $125. , people are answering online and they're telling you about themselves and you're trusting that that information is accurate, ? How do you vet that it is? for example, if I'm giving this to a cancer researcher, I could be a drug addict, which is going to completely skew the test. , I leave that to the researcher to decide what is that one burden of proof that the person has to submit to be qualified. They only upload a little bit and then you reach out to them according to the study and say, \"Do you have more proof?\" Exactly. You put the information that the researchers will use. , let let me ask some more about yourself. , where where in Queens are you from? , I lived in Flushing for a little bit. I'm from Haiti. I I grew up in Haiti, but in Haiti, we got the earthquake. after high school, I moved to New York because I had a lot of families there. And that's where opportunities took me and worked my butt off. I worked up to five jobs in college and majoring in chemistry and biochemistry and graduated with honors in biomedical science research at Queens College. I tutored French, Spanish, math, chemistry, and biology to private students. I was selling bags and and watches at Fossil and I was working also next door selling jeans and shirts at American Eagle. Wow. , I got a full scholarship to go to Penn State for both an MD and a PhD. Can I make a non-political comment here? You you're the exact reason why America should open up to immigrants. , cuz what a wonderful example you are and to come from Haiti and do such great work. But why do you think it's going to be a pandemic? What we've realized in the past decade or is that there are subtypes of the same disease that's directly based off your genes and your DNA. the only way to figure this thing out is to study people's DNA. Do you have a database? you go through hospitals and research centers who know who needs this DNA. Yes. the researchers are there. Are you going out to them or are they coming to you? both. . Both. But give me an example. How much money do they typically give you? Do they need 10 samples? A typical study at an academic institution would need 30,000 samples up to 100,000 samples, but the range is extremely wide. You could use a small study where you need 25 samples. Have you sold any far? Yes, we have. We've matched over 500. We've sold for $30,000. And how are you sourcing your subjects? The most effective far has been social media. How'd you get the trust for your company? It it was a little tougher at the beginning. Now that we've have significant press this year, I made the Forbes list 30 under 30 in science. , that's Yeah, that's . , thank you. And , we've been everywhere. , now it's more we need the machine to get more of a presence social media. I used to sell my blood all the time. That was the only way I could afford. Yeah. , but this is a new age version of that. Yes. It's amazing. Where's the competitive advantage, Olivier? Why is your company worth a million dollars today? , I've worked in the field, I understand exactly what researchers want and what can pass and what will not pass. I did this research for my PhD. I think that's a competitive advantage there. But obviously if we get one of you sharks on board, that's a significant advantage. What do you need the money for? Do you need entry into larger research facilities? Do you need until I have 100,000 people in my database? I can't go to Fiser and say, I want to help you lead that next big research you're going to do. Some researchers in a 5year grant, you spend three to four years to recruit people. Wow. , there are studies that die because let's say you're doing a study where you need a thousand blacks or Hispanics, and I'm in Hershey, Pennsylvania. No offense, it would take about 100 years to get those people, ? , less than 5% of clinical trials have minorities in them. Some people are hard to find. And this idea, that's their competitive advantage. , look, I've sat here listening for for a change and not contributed. But having listened, I think it's interesting. I'm incredibly impressed with you and your drive. I'll offer you $100,000 for 25%. [Music] I'll make you an offer, but I want you to say yes or no now. . I'll give you $200,000 for 20%. [Music] Mark, is it is it if I listen to a couple offers? I I appreciate that offer if you want to do business with me. And if not, I understand. You have two offers on the table. Would you be willing to decrease a little bit in the equity and go 15? Sure. Yep. Deal. Deal. Done. , master from Congratulations. I love the idea, man. We'll make that. We'll kill it. We'll change the world at least. I'll give I'll give you a hug as . done. I still think it I get on. Yeah. No, go.

originally from kakas Venezuela and together we found it toasted we're here today seeking $100,000 in exchange for 5% equity in our business sharks when we moved to the US from Venezuela we spent years craving Great South American food but we couldn't find authentic and convenient options in the market and that is why we decided to create toasted a brand of better for you Latin American food Staples that are ready to eat in under 10 minutes we decided to focus on a South American classic Thea it is a cornmeal bread that is crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside and perfect for stuffing with your favorite fillings we offer different flavors from Chia flax seed to Yuka to our original corn recipe all with zero added sugars and trans fats with three to four grams of protein per serving and they're also gluten-free sharks the Hispanic Community is the fastest growing minority in the US and the love for Hispanic food it's mainstream Across America who's ready to join us in becoming the go-to brand for great and authentic Hispanic food all sharks let's try some samples yeah I'm starving but we have here today our original Aras they're filled with sweet plantain and queso blanco we also have the Chia flaxy vas with some guacamole and our Cava or Juka Aras with some mozzarella cheese this is good thank you much this is the classic with the cornmeal it's a bread that you can do anything with you can stuff it with all different fillings or you can top it as a toast is that kept refrigerated or Frozen our products are frozen but are you already in stores this is real packaging you already on shelves cor we are currently in about 900 stores including Publix Walmart we recently got distribution at Whole Foods Markets and wind Dixie all the Central Market in Texas wow tell us a little bit about your background we're both originally from Venezuela we mentioned with sisters we moved to the states about 80 years ago because of the political and social turmoil that the country is still currently facing and looking for better opportunities for ourselves we worked hard to get a good education and start our corporate careers here I started working one of the largest cpg companies in the US and my sister started her career in the banking industry but there was something or a feeling between the two of us we were missing a part of our culture and our traditions and specifically our food and we started thinking between the two of us what we could innovate and we started experimenting with recipes in our own homes while keeping our full-time jobs we came up with with the first skiu which is the traditional ARA that is ready to toast in 5 minutes did you have any background in manufacturing Foods at all nothing we knew nothing what do you sell them for how much do you make them for what's the revenue let's talkn last year were 200,000 this year we've made about 190,000 in 5 months you think you'll get to 400 this year we're going to get about to 500,000 by the end of this year we sell them for 323 is Blended of the four skus it cost us 230 our gross margins are 30% after a little light a little light on the gross margins after selling and distribution expenses is 20% that's not good enough what are you going to what are you going to do to fix that packaging we already have a deal to reduce packaging by half and in ingredients there's a lot of opportunity to bring cost down and do you have competition not in the Frozen aisle there are other areas sitting in the in the in the refrigerated aisle I the product I got to tell you why I'm not a diabetic but I monitor my glucose I I wanted to try this root one it didn't spike it I found a bread I can eat thank you for bringing that up that's amazing this is a solution for me and lots of other people that diet the way I do we don't eat gluten and The Taste is phenomenal thank you I love to invest I love to invest in stuff that I use I I I don't know how you're going to make any money with these crummy margins this is the first year that we're going to be profitable but have you paid yourselves anything no that's the thing we haven't been paying ourselves look it's a flyer I'll give you the 100 Grand I want [Music] 20% there's only one Mr wonderful thank God for that but Mr Wonderful you're cting a valuation by one you're valuing at 500,000 I know that and that's what we're going to make this year it's unfair to Val time sales Mak sense to me for a commodity guys I'll simplify things to help you figure things out look it's a great product getting to 200,000 sales with the distribution you have from where you've started is phenomenal it's not something that I get excited about even though the product is amazing for those Reasons I'm out thank you much we appreciate it I love this but my concern was refrigerated trucks cost a lot now there's not a lot of space in those grocery stores and for you to get where you have gotten I have no idea how have you done that I will be purchasing this but I'm out thank you Dam thank you much Damon I think you're impressive and thank you much you two are Mighty you have gotten into five major retailers in the shortest amount of time it's fantastic thank you Lori I tasted it it's delicious but it's not the business for me this deal I am out but I'm not worried about you you're fantastic what is your path for improving your margins because to Mr Wonderful's point it's the more you grow the more you're digging a hole and with a 33% margin you're not going to be able to run a viable business have you thought about what you're going to do we are attacking it at different F funds one is the Machinery that we bought that's going to help us optimize our production proc esses second we were able to negotiate a better packaging deal that cut the cost of our packaging by half one last question what level of commitment do you have Daniel this is our baby it's my first baby I have the second B baby on the belly Cur congratulations thank you we we started this as we said from our own kitchen I was the first to quit my full-time job I had a great job and then my sister did the same thing we are extremely passionate about not only the product but our mission to promote our culture and to be ambassadors of the food that we grew up eating Daniel you know Mr liri has an offer and they're my offer is getting toast it maybe in your hand I you guys I your energy I your commitment I don't the margins I don't the Frozen space is tricky based on your $200,000 in sales the best I can do is to match his offer I will give you the $100,000 for 20% you need to decide if you want to swim with a shark or be eaten by one would you do 150,000 for 15% I wouldn't do that deal sorry I I also give you that offer Daniel no but you heard my feelings no no no I gave you exact same offer I would love to work with you Daniel I think there's many things that we could do together what was your counter again 150 for 15% that's $1 million R I'm Val I'm valuing the business at 500,000 one times revenue for a baked goods non proprietary terrible margin business the only reason I it is you guys and and it doesn't spite my glucose I'll give you instead of $100,000 I'll give you $150,000 for [Music] 20% guys this is my final offer it's generous offer you have a deal Dan good job Daniel

New Jersey and we're here seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% of our company Dan and I have been athletes our whole lives but as these bones get older our muscles don't recover as quickly that's for sure that's why I go see this guy for help as a physical therapist I use specific tools and techniques muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation reduce pain and speed up the recovery process yep Dan's worked Wonders on my body but I can't bring him home with me that's why we teamed up to create sore soap the world's first do-it-yourself device made from allnatural analgesic essential oil powered soap it's designed to replicate the same Physical Therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office soap's been around for centuries as a matter of fact muscle scraping has been too we're the first to combine them switch your old boring bar to sore soap 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue Health Plus sore soap smells amazing lathers wonderfully and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged sharks I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up and believe me I haven't felt this good since the '90s tell me which one of you is sore enough to join us in the shower no Dan in the company let's show the world the power of a shower with sore soap in front of you sharks is your own sore soap and our other line of products and Dan and I will talk you through how to use them now if anybody could maybe roll up their sleeve look Robert's already got his watch off he's ready to go I we knew you would if you want to take a towel and you ring out some water you'd be in the shower hold your sore soap on about a 15\u00b0 angle the purple one take the small concave side you want to go down on you here show a couple scrapes 20 to 30 Strokes on a 15 to 20\u00b0 Angle now it lathers up guys it will lather up and the point is to go downward you're massaging feels pretty good there's Menthol lavender and chamomile in it they're all anti does smell great yeah the beauty of our product we've Incorporated it into an activity of daily living that everybody does everybody woke up this morning and they shower why not do it in a therapeutic way that promotes soft tissue Health why therapy work the scientific answer is an increased what's called fi blast proliferation which leads to collagen synthesis all that means is it's encouraging tissue remodeling tissue regeneration what is this that's a polycarbonate tool called sore tool pro and what's great about is you could put it in your pocket go for a run you get a cramp you get sore you could use that what is your background guys I grew up playing sports my whole life I found myself in the trainer's room I grew in affinity for the Health Science field got my undergrad in biology then I went and got my doctorate in physical therapy I opened up my own practice David was a patient of mine first then he became a friend and now he's a business partner what's your background a long story short this is the first time in my life that I've felt I've been able to combine all of my loves my passion for sports the way the human body works and design into all these products we're helping people feel better David you were a designer by trade for the last 25 years I've been a graphic designer what do it C for you to make it what do you sell it for and what are your sales year to date Dan yeah our our lifetime sales are 125,000 this last quarter we're having our best quarter yet we're about to get to 70,000 what is your lifetime when did you start we started about 2 years ago what do you sell it for and what does it cost you to make the two bars cuz we sell two at a time and the holder we sell it for $23 and it cost us $852 to make have you you got any wholesale orders yet yep we sell in some physical therapy offices and some Boutique gyms manatt between 15 and 17 that's margin for retail let me make a point about the product category for a second there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think it's going to be challenging to explain this I will use it but as an investor I'm out all even though I think it would do great on some of your and then there's one honestly my neck has been killing me I you watch me do all this back of your neck immediately that's the only reason I'm going to give you an offer thank God for Tex neck it fix my damn neck you wanted 100 for 10 I'll give you 100 for 20 how about

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext into the tank is a business created to aid and optimize medical research. [Music] Hello sharks. My name is Olivia Noel. I'm from Queens, New York. My company is DNA Simple and I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange for 12 and a half% of the company. Sharks. Experts are saying that we are due for a new pandemic, a catastrophic disease that can devastate humanity. And that's why medical research is even more important than ever. And that's where we come in. DNS Simple is looking to make genetic research happen 10 times faster that cures to diseases can be found 10 times faster. And my company is paying you for your saliva samples. It's all anonymous and it happens in four easy steps. Number one, you tell me about yourself in 2 minutes on our DNA simple website. Number two, we match you to a research study that's looking for people you. Number three, we ship you this little tube to your house with a prepaid step. And number four, we give you $50 after you've returned the sample back to us. And you can do this as many times as you can. You heard correctly. We're paying you for spinning in the tube. Normally, it's an extremely expensive and long process for researchers to get enough samples for studies. And our company is making it simple. We pay you for a spit, researchers get the samples they need, and we get paid for making it all happen. It's a win-win for everybody. Now, sharks, who's ready to join me in saving mankind? I will come around and show you what the kits look . Great. Is this one for you? Thanks, Olivia. Let me give Lori hers. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Thank you, sir. You're welcome, Lori. Hopefully, you do match a study and get your $50. Thank you much. Great. You said that you spit into the tube, send it back to you, you will pay that person $50, and they can do it as often as they want. They get matched for a study. Correct. For example, if there are 10 researchers across the US that are looking for someone aged 20 to 45 that fit in a particular profile. No, get it . 20 to 25. 20. In your case, 20 to 25. Yes. And every time you do match, you get a notification that you can participate to the study and then we send you a kit and every time you can get that $50. Olivia, I only get $50 if you can match me to a study. I will send this to you after you've matched the study. . how much are they paying you? Typically, it would go around 155 per. , the research companies are paying you $155 and you're paying $50 of that off the top. Yes. For the sample, correct? Any other cost to you? , the kit, we have we're making the kits inhouse. And what's it cost you to make each one? $125. , people are answering online and they're telling you about themselves and you're trusting that that information is accurate, ? How do you vet that it is? for example, if I'm giving this to a cancer researcher, I could be a drug addict, which is going to completely skew the test. , I leave that to the researcher to decide what is that one burden of proof that the person has to submit to be qualified. They only upload a little bit and then you reach out to them according to the study and say, \"Do you have more proof?\" Exactly. You put the information that the researchers will use. , let let me ask some more about yourself. , where where in Queens are you from? , I lived in Flushing for a little bit. I'm from Haiti. I I grew up in Haiti, but in Haiti, we got the earthquake. after high school, I moved to New York because I had a lot of families there. And that's where opportunities took me and worked my butt off. I worked up to five jobs in college and majoring in chemistry and biochemistry and graduated with honors in biomedical science research at Queens College. I tutored French, Spanish, math, chemistry, and biology to private students. I was selling bags and and watches at Fossil and I was working also next door selling jeans and shirts at American Eagle. Wow. , I got a full scholarship to go to Penn State for both an MD and a PhD. Can I make a non-political comment here? You you're the exact reason why America should open up to immigrants. , cuz what a wonderful example you are and to come from Haiti and do such great work. But why do you think it's going to be a pandemic? What we've realized in the past decade or is that there are subtypes of the same disease that's directly based off your genes and your DNA. the only way to figure this thing out is to study people's DNA. Do you have a database? you go through hospitals and research centers who know who needs this DNA. Yes. the researchers are there. Are you going out to them or are they coming to you? both. . Both. But give me an example. How much money do they typically give you? Do they need 10 samples? A typical study at an academic institution would need 30,000 samples up to 100,000 samples, but the range is extremely wide. You could use a small study where you need 25 samples. Have you sold any far? Yes, we have. We've matched over 500. We've sold for $30,000. And how are you sourcing your subjects? The most effective far has been social media. How'd you get the trust for your company? It it was a little tougher at the beginning. Now that we've have significant press this year, I made the Forbes list 30 under 30 in science. , that's Yeah, that's . , thank you. And , we've been everywhere. , now it's more we need the machine to get more of a presence social media. I used to sell my blood all the time. That was the only way I could afford. Yeah. , but this is a new age version of that. Yes. It's amazing. Where's the competitive advantage, Olivier? Why is your company worth a million dollars today? , I've worked in the field, I understand exactly what researchers want and what can pass and what will not pass. I did this research for my PhD. I think that's a competitive advantage there. But obviously if we get one of you sharks on board, that's a significant advantage. What do you need the money for? Do you need entry into larger research facilities? Do you need until I have 100,000 people in my database? I can't go to Fiser and say, I want to help you lead that next big research you're going to do. Some researchers in a 5year grant, you spend three to four years to recruit people. Wow. , there are studies that die because let's say you're doing a study where you need a thousand blacks or Hispanics, and I'm in Hershey, Pennsylvania. No offense, it would take about 100 years to get those people, ? , less than 5% of clinical trials have minorities in them. Some people are hard to find. And this idea, that's their competitive advantage. , look, I've sat here listening for for a change and not contributed. But having listened, I think it's interesting. I'm incredibly impressed with you and your drive. I'll offer you $100,000 for 25%. [Music] I'll make you an offer, but I want you to say yes or no now. . I'll give you $200,000 for 20%. [Music] Mark, is it is it if I listen to a couple offers? I I appreciate that offer if you want to do business with me. And if not, I understand. You have two offers on the table. Would you be willing to decrease a little bit in the equity and go 15? Sure. Yep. Deal. Deal. Done. , master from Congratulations. I love the idea, man. We'll make that. We'll kill it. We'll change the world at least. I'll give I'll give you a hug as . done. I still think it I get on. Yeah. No, go.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nnext up is a more stylish way to enjoy your [Music] lunch hi sharks my name is Ali kinety I'm the founder of modern picnic and I'm here seeking $400,000 in exchange for 6.5% of my company as a young professional working in New York City I would go into the office every day trying to look feel and do my best but when it came to packing lunch my options were unprofessional and definitely not stylish sure I could use a brown paper bag but my mom doesn't pack my lunch anymore and a plastic bag definitely not sustainable or functional or I could carry something this but I wouldn't be caught dead carrying this into the office sharks the outdated lunchbox needed a makeover I gave it one meet modern picnic fashionable insulated vegan leather lunch boxes you can bring your food wherever you go and no one would ever know what to lunchbox and we launched with our first product the luncher which as you can see here Chic functional and clean with the easily wipable interior to protect against those everyday spills but that's not all since we've launched we've since come out with the range of different shapes and sizes for all of your meal prep needs whether that be our toad or backpack because sometimes bigger is better our snacker perfect for the little things or our newly launched food containers designed to fit perfectly inside sharks who's ready to ditch those childish lunchboxes in those wasteful paper and plastic bags with modern picnic I hope you guys are hungry because I packed your lunch today in front of you you're some of our bestselling products let's open it up and see what's inside clever alley super cool what are you going to do to the per snatching industry cuz when they steal this expecting to find jewels in it you're going to find a ham and Ry in here it's a great idea I think it's worth 30 I was 22 years old when I came up with the idea for modern picnic and was able to successfully launch a company within 2 years with absolutely no prior experience connections funding highlighting my ability to make things happen not only myself but most importantly the company figure things out good for you how old are you now I'm 29 amazing and what do they cost what do you sell them for they range our aovs $155 we call ourselves attainable luxury you guys will love this our product margins are EX excellent averaging in the ' 80s landed duties paid it drops down to the 70s and gross margin it's a healthy 60 give us a dollar amount for this yeah the little one what do you sell it for what is that is around 30 35 what what you sell it for 159 wow allly the issue is you can't sell this in retail because people are going to compare it to purses not understanding the vision of The Lunchbox it's all online now while our e-commerce direct a consumer business accounts to the majority of our Revenue what's the majority 70% we started going wholesale this year and it's already accounted for 20% of our sales we are now sold in Sachs we launched in The Container Store and this morning good I got my vendor number for Bloomingdales which I think is a sign you're asking for a 6.15 million yes valuation you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business we've done under $6 million in cumul of sales from over 40,000 units sold what year did you start we launched in 2018 and what will you do this year we're projected to do over 2 million in sales this year and how much will you make this year we're projected to lose under $100,000 in sales why are you not profitable where are you spending the money the money's got to be going somewhere because if you're you said you're going to do how much this year over 2 million and you've got 60% margins that's 1.2 million in gross margin cont contribution where's that 1.2 million go yeah and in terms of how we're acquiring customers in recent years we've created an emphasis on having a healthy Diversified marketing mix we do affiliate marketing Tik Tok email SMS we have a optimized website but there's definitely I love how excited you are I want to go back to Mark's question yeah 1.2 million in gross margin where did that money go how much did you spend on Advertising about 25% of our revenue is going towards marketing that's where it is Ally I'm still trying to wrap my head around how you're spending money now if 25% of your costs are going is that digital marketing and you're spending additional money in brand marketing that's correct what is the total cost of marketing when you look at that 1.2 what is the total cost of markings it's not 25 it's much more than that yeah it and that's why we're how much I would say it's probably 50% on total marketing that's it's too much on marketing yeah way too much because that's that's where all your money is going it's you are way overpaying to find customers now and that's why you're not putting enough money on the bottom line because your margins are pretty good for this type of product your margins are amazing you're you're overpaying to acquire customers now do you have investors as I mentioned food strapped the company for a couple of years shipping out of my parents garage they're you got to get out and in 2020 I knew I had to raise some capital I had absolutely no idea what it meant to raise capital I went out and cold Outreach to 1,300 investors my ended up raising $900,000 what yeah we currently have a seed round proper seed round open which we've raised an additional 900,000 for you've raised the first 900 plus another 900 Ellie let me take a crack at this I applaud you on what you've achieved here and your presentation was almost flawless until we got into the numbers you're spending much money trying to build a brand and I have zero interest in funding a brand in fashion that is hard to do and pretty soon you're going to figure out that's not a good Pursuit I'm out thank you much yeah allly I would say you need to have more confidence in yourself and your product and I know that sounds counterintuitive but when you're spending much on Advertising that's typically because the entrepreneur is afraid that sales might fall we're afraid there won't be the demand there if you stop you're having to go out and raise money you have to be disciplined to spend less yeah it's not for me I'm out allly you're a Dynamo great presentation Kevin said I don't think the numbers work now I'm sorry I'm out thank you what I don't love is when a young company does many raises fast for much money I'm a big believer in you make money you roll it back in and I'm sorry I'm out yeah thank you shipping out of my parents garage we had to raise some money because we had to move out and we had to make some changes we were putting zero dollars into marketing the first three years in the garage and that's why we raised that that's you said it yourself go back to those times yeah I think one of the biggest lessons that I learned when I started good American and let me tell you I had two different sets of investors I had the old guys and the young guys the young guys said to me spend spend spend chase that Topline growth and the old guys said to me you're going to need profit when the tid's turn you have to think about running and that is lucky I was I'm going to listen to these old guys cuz they look richer and they've done more business and I think about this all the time it is a curse of many young Founders that I know that they have plowed much money into the belief that digital marketing coupled brand marketing and spending these huge percentages is leading to all of these sales but never ever looking at the fundamentals of the business what I will say to you and what I've seen in my own experience if you look at whatever you're spending on meta on Facebook on Tik Tok in any other platforms you start winding it down I'm telling you I I almost guarantee it you will not see a difference in your sales I think you're amazing I love the products I'll be a customer but for those Reasons I'm out good luck Ally we wish you all the best thank you thank you for sharing this with us today\n\nNLP

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi, I'm Adam Cookson. Hi, I'm Craig Bicki. We're from Denver, Colorado. Our company is Techry. We're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, this toilet stands before you today guilty of a terrible crime. Murder. That's . This porcelain perpetrator is the number one reason people lose phones to water damage. It doesn't stop there. Toilets, swimming pools, washing machines. Each year in the US, these kill 22 million phones with water damage. We've invented a machine that can bring phones, tablets, laptops, watches, anything that fits in the chamber back to life. It's not magic. It's science. Have a look inside our machine in real time. Transforming liquid into gas. Restoring your phone in 30 minutes. No need to disassemble or take anything apart. Sharks, this is my personal phone. It has no special protection, but I'm not worried. And I'm not worried. You murderer. , let's make a deal. Sharks. This is one opportunity you don't want to flush away. gosh. I'm going to take a moment to rescue this phone and then show you our process. This is a gut-wrenching moment for customers. Bring it in for service as quick as you can. Your device starts rusting as soon as it gets wet. , inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. , I feel it's a heart attack. You got to get CPR fast, ? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. ? , technically someone could ship it to you. , are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as as we have a mail-in service. But what are your sales? last year with a few stores we did $29,000 82 stores, ? We're talking about last year. Sorry, did you say that last year you sold the incredible amount of how much? $29,000 in sales with a few stores. We focused on making the economics on a per store basis profitable. . And then we launched to 82 stores and only two months later we've been asked to launch to 600 stores. What were your sales after the balance of the stores? this year we're on track with the expansion to hit $650,000. you go to a store and you say, \"Put this in for free or do they pay you?\" , you don't pay unless it works. They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? , in the in the beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? , on average, it works out to about $80 rent a month. Wait, $80 rent per month you're charging them. And then on top of that, we get a rev share, a percentage of the revenue. What's the percentage? On average, it's about 16%. , in order to do all this, you had to have raised a bunch of capital. We've raised 2.2 million far. Wow. Wow. And what was the value of the company post money? It had a valuation cap of 4.8 million. why is your valuation high? This is about getting to $800 per month per store. That's $6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in profit. But you're not doing that today. No. But if you discount that back from when we will be doing it, that's still far above $10 million. And what do you place as a value on that risk in case you don't execute? , honestly, I see you totally as an online business. You said you have three days, , in which it can still survive. We have an online market, but we haven't been able to afford national marketing for the online. I don't understand why you think you want to go retail. I don't see the big market. I'm out. Thank you. You came in asking for a $10 million valuation and I don't know how you're going to make that back that fast. And , unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. I think technology is your enemy. I was reading something the other day that the new Apple phone is almost totally water resistant. , I think the technology improvements can put you out of business by the time you figure out your model. Wouldn't put my money there amount. Guys, look, I the idea. I the concept, but you you're going to have to keep on raising capital. And unless I gave you that capital, I'm going to keep on getting diluted. The problem is how do I get my money back? , one of the reasons I think we're going to succeed is not because we may have a good plan. It's because we have an awesome team. Have you ever heard anybody start a company, hire their people, and say, \"We have a horrible team.\" That's not enough. I'm out. , everybody's out. Mr. Wonderful's left. I the story. I understand the model. I I don't want to argue about your valuation. I think it's too high. I'm going to loan you this 500k at 13%, but I'm taking the 5% as an equity warrant. That's the value I bring as a shark to this. , I want it paid back in 36 months. What do you think of this offer? Would you be willing to go more than 500,000 now? You asked for 500. That's the deal I would do. And I'm the only shark here today willing to give you an offer. , what do you want to do? All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We'll take that deal. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. That's terrific. Thank you much. Sounds Kevin. Let's see how your new investment works. Do it, Mark. That's great. , God. All , guys. Thanks. Do it. You got to have confidence. Do it. Kevin, if you believe in and the product, why not put it in the water? I'm not doing that.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Adam Cookson, Craig Bicki, Wonderful, Kevin, Mark (PERSON), Denver, Colorado, US (GPE), Techry, Apple (ORG), 5%, about 16%, 13%, the 5% (PERCENT), 30 minutes (TIME)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the chamber, our company, water damage, the machine, the time, a store, your sales, a few stores\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 500,000\n  \u2022 kill: phones\n  \u2022 invent: machine\n  \u2022 have: look\n  \u2022 transform: liquid\n  \u2022 restore: phone\n  \u2022 have: protection\n  \u2022 bring: it\n  \u2022 have: beads\n  \u2022 turn: liquid\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.11)\n\n**Topics:** store, phone, machine, shark, year",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] next up is a convenient way for couples to spend more time [Music] together hi sharks I'm Brett and I'm Jeff and we are the co-founders of bua we're seeking $400,000 for 10% of our company sharks let's be honest showering with a partner sounds fun but in reality [Music] it sucks one person's hogging all the hot water and the other's left shivering in the corner sure two showerheads would solve the problem but am I going to spend thousands of dollars on a renovation now you don't have to introducing bua tandem shower tandem is the only easy and costeffective way to add a second shower head to your bathroom it optimizes the water pressure using our Custom Engineered showerheads tandem installs in minutes it's simple all you have to do is extend the rod add the valve and connect the shower heads that's it no fancy contractors no knocking down walls it's an instant Spa upgrade sharks we're done showering on our own tandem is way more fun with a partner and we're looking for a long-term romance with one of you all Hannah David Shower times over sharks we've got some samples of Tandem in front of you and we'd welcome your questions how about the pressure do you divide the pressure in two the pressure first thing that we thought about and the main thing is we have 5,000 customers and our average rating is 4.7 out of five but what about the pressure yeah we could speak to the pressure I think the point more for us is the pressure was always a top of mine concern for any customer and it was great for us to see that the rating hit 4.7 th000 people bu over over 5,000 customers far over what period of time we did pre-order first and that started in April 2022 I'm surprised you have that many is this that big a problem yeah it's not a problem but it's an opportunity one thing I think one thing that's interesting is we went live in July and we started posting some some content on social media and we ended up blowing up we hit 50 million views on Tik Tok and 50 million views on Instagram and have over 50,000 followers on both platforms and a mailing list of over 40,000 people wow you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business the sales off the kickstarter were 750,000 wow how many units is that about 3,000 something what do you think you'll do this calendar year and will you make any money we think we're going to do 1.7 because we have done it's all organic this year once we went live we blew up how much you going to make on 17 our gross profit margin is 71% but but what's your net profit profit is 54% net profit is 54 you're going to make good for you you you think you're going to make over $850,000 yeah why does this item cost we have the first skew is $2.49 and that's with one of our showerheads then the second SK why would you even sell that a lot of customers are married to their handheld shower or maybe they purchase a showerhead that they and they're not ready to commit to our aesthetic and performance what is the other skew cost the two together is $2.99 the single head can you walk me through the cost landed cost of that one and then the dual head what's the landed cost of that one $69 landed for the first one it's we averaged it they're co9 landed for both SKS is what you're saying that's you're making money on every single sale now that's yeah what's your ultimate goal out of this we want to build a brand I think we have a lot of Ip around this product but we're not banking the business on it the next obvious opportunity for us is that the handhelds we have tons of customers that aren't converting it's a deriv of this you're going to stay in the shower St for sure for the beginning we are tandem focused when you think you'll hit 5 million in sales next year next year I don't buy it as a company yet I see it as a interesting Innovation as a product and some of the greatest deals in Shark Tank history is when the entrepreneur focused on that one application and maxed it out Max that's our Focus now I'm not sure you were telling me about building a business other SKS a brand strategy which scares me that's the biggest mistake startups make they you want to be a brand as opposed to executing on selling their product what builds because what builds a brand is your execution toally what too many companies do I'm doing brand marketing this is for the brand I'm going out there and I'm I'm presenting this I'm going to this trade show because I want to build my brand that's why for us the absolute focus is definitely on tandem and if we do create new products it's to support I say I can't relate to the product at all for two reasons one I'm a bther and I love high pressure and I'm concerned about you cutting the pressure in half secondly I couldn't imagine getting into a shower with my husband Bill getting naked it would be my idea of the worst nightmare on his side and online forget it you have a a younger demographic amount Brad I Jeff you guys have built a great business I bought a super fancy house with 10 shower heads and consistently I use one I'm not the person who would buy this I think it's hard for me to get there I'm out I wish you all the best guys I think it's a great product I think this is going to be a cash generating machine and the biggest mistake you can make would be to try to grow too fast take the money people are throwing at you but that's not conducive to an investor because if it's 400,000 for 10% you have to generate $4 million in after tax profits for me to get my money back I don't see it as an investable business I see it as an amazing business for you guys but for those Reasons I'm out I think you guys are amazing but I'm not connecting with the product as something for me to invest in I'm sorry I'm out I it I'm going to make you two offers you can choose between the two of them number one I'll do the $400,000 with a royalty per unit of $40 I would stop the royalty after I get 1.2 million back and I'll take the 10% Equity in case we sell it or I give you the $400,000 and I'm the third partner 33 and 13% and every dollar that comes out I'm getting 33 A3 Cent you're going to rush to do those deals you can decide because that's what I that's what I think is worth or or you can go have a shower how about 20% for $600,000 no 20% the comp $600,000 the funny thing is you you don't need 400,000 why would you do that to make it more he he gets more equity in the company no I know why you would do it to try to entice him why would you need to do that that's the only red flag that I've seen why would you give up 20% of your company even for $600,000 if you do 5 million next year you're making million Millions yeah millions of dollars and you're giving up a fifth of that you're guys you have an offer on the table what do you want to do what do you want to are you willing to negotiate on your offer I haven't heard anything I've heard squawking all I hear is squawking the only offer you have is me you we allow to come back in remember that go back in I'm still curious why would you give up 20% of your company for $600,000 when you're anticipating doing how much in sales this year we definitely think that it's going to be a discount on on what we're worth and what we've built here and demonstrated but for us this is a it's a it's a costly business how much cash do you have in the bank 250,000 for us it's having a resource that can help plus even strategize between different cash is an issue you may be profitable but because you're growing which got back to my point which is why I asked the question on profitability versus let's go go go go yeah we that's exactly what we want to do I'm out thank you you got to make a decision you can't do it that tells me you're not sharp you weren't going to do that deal that's I don't know but we don't have to worry about it see you later anyone else want to come back in no but guys Chase cash not sales you came to the Vice tank good luck guys thank you all much bye for us it went about as as we could have hoped we would have loved to have gotten a deal but I think their logic makes sense and I'm excited to continue building this business exactly as per their advice they had no ability to focus on the only offer they had you got to realize you have a real offer you got to focus on it I got bored fornext in the tank is an inspirational fashion brand from a teen with big [Music] dreams I'm powerful I'm powerful I'm strong I'm strong I'm courageous I'm courageous and we have an impact that

california our company is plunge and we're seeking 1.2 million dollars for a 5 stake in our company sharks what if i told you you could lower inflammation increase fat loss strengthen your immune system sleep better reduce muscle soreness have more energy in one minute this isn't fiction this is reality and this is not a bathtub this is a cold plunge studies show that cold plunging increases norepinephrine levels two to three times their normal amount i don't know what that is either but apparently that's what leads to all those incredible benefits sharks all over the world cold exposure is exploding but buying 40 pounds of ice is a huge hassle our revolutionary cold plunge uses powerful cooling and filtration to give you cold crystal clear water whenever you want all in a beautiful sleek tub set your temperature anywhere from 60 all the way down to 39. sharks who's ready to take the plunge wow how about you robert you look you could use the plunge i'll try it i'll try that's cool let's do it baby amazing what's the temperature set up it's five now 55 that's not bad it's pretty cold 55 no i've done cold plungers many times because we have one at the mavericks obviously why can't i fill up my tub with cold enough water cold out of the tap isn't going to be 55 maybe some times of the year if you're in a cold environment you can throw ice in it though that's what most people do now they're buying ice and then it's they have to drain it after where our unit is always filtering it's always set it's always clean it's about if all the key here is going to be anchoring to your breath your body is going to want to be excited you're going to want to get out but you want to override that with slo relax robert how long is he supposed to hold back the urge to jump out two minutes there he goes two minutes is ideal you can't do that robert you gotta get in don't be a wimp do i yep lay back get comfortable [Music] override the body your mind wants to get out breathe through it this is your body's loving totally safe slow down the breathing nice slow breaths beautiful be one with the cold he's gonna feel incredible after cold are you feeling numb you're getting used to it it's not as bad as when you're first walking but surprisingly the breathing helped and now it doesn't feel as bad i wouldn't say it's comfortable but it's not bad i'm here grabbing a towel there my god wow mark why do they do it why do the athletes do it it helps with inflammation i'll put my leg in it's incredible you feel your blood flowing seriously i feel no it wakes you up if you go on it wakes you up ready to go let's go let's go michael and ryan the big ice cube in the room is the 1.2 million for five percent and shoots a 24 million dollar valuation you better be selling a lot of them we launched a year ago we were building out of his garage 12 months ago we sold our first unit to date we've done 4.9 million dollars in sales wow over the 12 months 4.9 year-to-date 4.5 and we're on pace this month through one point one walk us through the economics yeah thank you thank you what's it cost to make one and how much do you sell it for and how do you sell it we sell them all on our website and this plunge is 4 800 it's affordable our landed cost is 2 400 and that does include shipping do you have an installation service that's the amazing part of it it shows up they put it wherever you want it from there you have about 15 minutes of setup and that 15 minutes is mostly filling up with a hose the question is how big is your market because what happens when somebody comes up with a good product you get all the pen up demand as people hear about it and they dive in you get this initial surge at a 24.5 million valuation and only having five percent you have to make 24 million dollars in distributable cash profits in order for us to get our money back i have to think in terms not only can i get my money back but how much more money can i make in it and for you to come on here with that valuation i can't blame you i can i'll do the blaming i the deal because of the revenue but i also see lots of competitors that could knock you off i'll make you an offer i'll give you the 1.2 million for 18 equity but i have to get my money back somehow i get 18 of the distributions you get the rest every time you take out a dollar i get 18 cents [Music] let me tell you what i think i agree with mark i think about how many years is going to take me to get my money back i wish you the best of luck but i'm out guys is more money better is the 1.2 million when you've calculated what you need or is it if you got more money would it make life better would make things go faster 1.2 million gets us it's enough for 400 units that we can build what we want to do with the money is to ramp up production i'm going to give you an offer i'll give you the 1.2 for 20 and it's going to be in the form of half a loan or line of credit whatever you prefer because i think that's your real need you have cash flow problems and then the other 50 up front got it thank you i asked a question about cash because i wanted to see what you were doing with it if you have more cash do things go faster and it sounds they do i'll give you 2.4 million 1.2 million for straight equity i want 15 for that and i'll give you the other 1.2 million as a straight up loan same rate you will get from the bank because i do think more money will make things go faster that's my offer [Music] guys i'll simplify all that i'll offer you the 1.2 million 15 i'll finance your purchase orders and it's got to be first dollar back to me on the sale and if you finance 100 units or 200 when you sell those i get paid back first it's first dollar back got it you guys you now have four offers

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a product designed to help you get a grip on athletic performance. [Music] Hello Sharks. My name is Greg and I'm James. We are seeking a strategic partner and also $400,000 for 4% equity in our company. Hello James. What do all athletes need to perform at their peak? Three things, Greg. They need focus, training, and grip. , did you throw that? You guys have insurance for that, ? , . Grip. Grip is something we all take for granted. It's breathing. But what if we told you there was a revolutionary material that could alter performance outcomes in virtually any sport? Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement technology used to absorb oil on the skin and it's used for athletes, the military, and everyday uses that once applied absorbs oil in the skin that creates the slip in grip. Our grip solution is made from a unique but - tested material that's non-toxic, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, works even after being underwater, and is the first significant innovation in grip technology in nearly 70 years. We want a shark to come up and try it with us. Rashan. , how about you come up and try chocolates? Go get them, Rashan. Here, let's give you a try on the torque test. We'll see how you do. , here, step over here, please. . All . What I'm going to ask you to do when I say start is you're going to grab that metal bar and you're going to rotate it backwards as hard as you can. ? , our patent pending piece of equipment measures the amount of torque you're able to generate before your grip starts to slip. Got it? , let me push the start button. All . . Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. , excellent. All . , that there you maxed out about 14 pounds. You ever seen anything that? Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. , what we're going to do is we're going to put a single dose of chocolates on your hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. , we spring salt. You can barely see it. You can barely see it. You sprink it on. Now, put the other hand on top. . And grind them together. What you're doing, you're you're stripping away all the oil in your skin that makes it slippery between the cracks up. Yep. Once you're done, you clap away any residual material. And we're gonna do it again. , it's light. , you can barely feel anything. Let's see what happens. my god. Yeah, you tipped over the machine. Nice job. All , we'll see here. , that there, even with the machine tipping, which was your peak, you lost some of it there, you were still a 60% improvement in the overall torque you're able to generate once you got rid of that slippery component to your grip. Honestly, it didn't move at all. , it's it almost feels chalk, but more permanent almost. It's nothing chalk to be technically correct. That's why they call it chalk compared to chalk. What's the main difference? the main difference here is we're a subtractive material. we're trying to remove something. It's the oil on your skin that causes the problem. Let's talk sales. sales sales for this year thus far have been 740,000. Wow. here's the thing. Grip, no one thought about it, ? if no one's thinking about their grip, there's a huge marketplace for us in the grip. That's not true. Athletes deal with it. Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss deal with it. that's not nobody. No. What by nobody is the masses. , LeBron James, , LeBron James would benefit from our products much you cannot imagine. Then we don't want him to have it. Is this illegal in the NBA? No. Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, and fitness. And fitness is huge for us now. Yeah. And how much are you selling them for? , , this bottle here is $35.99. It's about 100 doses. And then the smaller one on display up here is $24.99. And how much does it cost you to make it? We prefer to have that discussion offline. Shark. How are we going to make a determination? We have and we have respectfully we have a supply chain. We make 67% margin on our product. you don't want us to work backwards, ? If you say you have 67% blended margins, then they know the fact that you gave us your blended margins but wouldn't tell us your cost annoyed the out of me. I'm out. Yeah. Thank Thank you. appreciate your honesty. How do you feel about it, Mark? Yeah. Yeah. , is there anything proprietary about it? , yes, there is. , we have two patents issued and two more pending for what? , for the material itself and the use of grip for the packaging and dispensing of the material and then also its use on different implements such as balls. Are you engineers? Are you What did you used to do? I'm a corrosion engineer by training. I'm involved with every major architectural firm in the country that gets involved with paint or coatings for high-rise structures, for nuclear power plants, for nuclear submarines. And what about you? , my full-time job is entirely chockless. My background was chemical engineering. How did you get your customers to come to you in the first place? That's our biggest problem. . If someone asks us what's your biggest challenge because that's why you're here, ? That's why we're here. much . is primarily for a strategic partnership to make our product know people know that we exist. Once they touch this product, they're sold. Hey guys, I I agree with you. I was getting ready to say that I'm a financial investor. I look to add accelerant to stuff that's growing fast. I do think it's a good fit for someone, but unfortunately not for me. I'm out. . No, thank you. Thank you, James and Greg. I can't even think of one thing I could do for you. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I have to get excited about what I invest in. And it's not in my wheelhouse, this this thing. It's a great product for you guys. It's not for me. , I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. The only way I can do this deals with a royalty because the valuation is nuts. It's $10 million. It's crazy. , I give you the $400,000. I want $2.50 a unit. And I I'll take that until I make back $4 million in revenue. Then it drops down to nothing. 25 cents in perpetuity and I get the 4%. And then I turn on my entire social media team to try and get your CAC down, your oz up, cuz I'm completely incentivized to sell as much as I can as fast as I can. It's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. That's why they call me Mr. Wonderful. It's the only offer it sounds you're going to get here. All . I don't think we should do it. They're not going to do it. There's no way that they're going to do it. Kevin, that's such a good deal. If you want me to come in with you to take your bases down, I'm telling you I would take a 100red or 200 of that if you want it. You want to do 200 of it? Sure. Same terms. I'm not changing my terms. The terms you outlined, I would do that deal. , yeah, we'll split it 50/50. I can get this in hands as he can with a bunch of athletes and we can figure that part of it out. before you say anything, Rashan wants to come into the deal with me. , you're going to get two sharks. Going to split. Lucky day. , two 200,000 each term stay the same. And I can get this in the hands of 20 to 30 athletes as I'm sure most of us here can easily. Rashan can get a lot of these guys, which I . That's why I wanted as my partner. , you think they'll talk about it. Will they be willing to state that they're using the product? I think if we opened another round in the future and we gave them the opportunity to have to invest and be equity investors as opposed to brand ambassadors. Yes, you can't afford to have them as as marketing guys because they're too expensive. But they love talking about what they are. it's two sharks. I go crazy on social. He does his connections and professional athletes. I think it's the best offer you're going to get here today. And by the way, zero flexibility. What do you think of the offer? I think we'll take it. Yay. All . You're a wise man. You're a wise man. You're a smart guy. That's a great deal. Listen. I I think that's great. I know. Can't even let go. I'm excited about that. I think we can help you guys. appreciate it. We got to get this in as many people's hands as possible. Send these small packages to 100 athletes. Let them come begging us after. Thank you. Thank you guys. It was nice to meet you all. Congratulations, guys. Dude, you got it.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 4%, 60%, 67%, the 4% (PERCENT), first (ORDINAL), nearly 70 years, this year, today (DATE), about 14 pounds (QUANTITY), NBA, CAC (ORG), Rashan (NORP)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, a bad offer, the skin, your grip, your skin, the main difference, no one, lebron james\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: partner\n  \u2022 need: focus\n  \u2022 throw: that\n  \u2022 have: insurance\n  \u2022 be: material\n  \u2022 create: slip\n  \u2022 got: it\n  \u2022 give: twist\n  \u2022 maxe: pounds\n  \u2022 see: anything\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.20)\n\n**Topics:** grip, guy, product, athlete, material",

here seeking $300,000 for 5% of our company when you think back to the past year what is the one thing in the world that people craved more space that's exactly what we did we've created more space for everyone let us introduce you to ootbox an outdoor plug-and-play experience it could be a backyard office or as this model shows it can be a popup shop it could even be an outdoor conference room it's a convenient space that's temperature controlled soundproof flexible and can be set outside in any environment at 80 squ ft an oop box is a beautiful bright eco-friendly space made from an upcycled shipping container it can be delivered anywhere and used for anything we make it simple for our customers an oop box rolls off the back of a truck plugs into any outlet and it is ready to go sharks oop box is the future demand has been increasing ever since our recent launch and now we need your help to keep up with that demand who here is an outof the-box thinker and wants to step inside this box and join us on our journey you are taking old shipping containers recycling them cleaning them up and putting on doors we we cut them in half they're they're 20ft Duo cons and we infill the size to make these beautiful spaces that we can put anywhere Rob and Allison I don't understand the need for this product can you please tell me I can I can come up with a thousand reasons for it but the question is how much let me tell you about our business model first that's always a scary response to a simple question we lease them and we sell them but when you sell them they start at 20,500 I can't I agree with you now Daniel what does the market think how many of you sold our Revenue to this point is $950,000 this year good and how long have you been in business since June 2020 are there zoning ordinances in place that would forbid you in certain towns for dropping them off in a backyard they can go anywhere technically we're considered a tool shed this is for a temporary use this is for somebody who is spending his or her time working on the toilet to get away from their kids which again is not going away exactly that's not going away and how much money have you raised to dat we've raised $870,000 and how much of the company did you give away 30% and what are your margins on this when we sell it it's about 40% we we each box cost us $122,000 to build most people are leasing them for between $800 and $11,000 a MTH do many of the people who lease from you do it shortterm and convert to a customer who buys the average leas lease term now is about 8 months and about 60% of our clients have renewed their lease gotten an additional box or requested to purchase the box that they have to me it seems a clever idea fit with Co perfectly but I don't think that this is the investment it's not something that I would be excited about I'm sorry I'm out thank you what I don't get you raise $870,000 why are you trying to raise $300,000 why do you need that money now our capacity is about five boxes a month that we're doing we need more space we see the potential to grow exponentially and that's what we need this money for but but that's a challenge guys you're constrained by your capital and your time and the availability of the boxes what I Look to invest in are hockey stick businesses where they feed on themselves and grow themselves and they're not necessarily fully Capital constrained and time constrained it's not the business for me to invest in for those Reasons I'm out I feel a significant portion of the momentum that you have is connected to co it's not clear to me that it's not connected to co and devaluation seems to not factor that in wish you the best but for those reasons am not I get it sales say everything the trouble with this business due to its capital requirements the capital goes in the more successful you are it's impossible to get it back out I hate doing deals where I kiss my money goodbye and then I never see it again I it where there's a way for me to get it back and I'm not greedy and I'm creative and I am Mr Wonderful here is what I'm thinking I give you $300,000 I take the 5% I'm a partner in the business but this is a royalty deal for sure and the way it works every silence Barbara because you don't have any creativity on I'm sure you're yeah I give you the 300,000 every time you sell a box you give me back $1,000 what happens if they Lee it yeah it's an advertised payback on the lease I'm getting a portion of the lease it's a way for me to get my Capital back but I want to make back 600,000 before the royalty goes to zero and I think what's going to happen is half your people will buy themselves out at some point royalty is hard to understand on on this type of product at least for me I'm going to tell you why I think your model is ingenious it's identical to a business I invested in boho Vans they were renting Camper vans retrofitted Camper vans that look cool I think they had maybe $250,000 in revenue and one year later they had5 million it blew up you're doing the identical thing I'd to make you an offer of $300,000 for 20% let me defend the 20% W 20% you could say that all I'll tell you something I'll tell you 5% that's a big difference difference is one's understandable one's less one's I can explain mine simply you got to give me back my Capital times two that's easy iik get a great offer what are you going to do 20% might sound Rich to you but you will never get someone with my skill set to explode your business I will do I don't sell product I build businesses that's what I'm good at I did it for myself I love words too but 20% is 20% 20% is 20% I'll tell you what I'll do to have fun to have fun and to make Barbara's night more interesting forget the whole royalty thing I'll do it for 15% I'll give you 300,000 for 15% now wow Barbara yes you do 300,000 for 7% no how much 7% I thought I heard 7 % I was insulted I'm more insulted by seven what about if we did seven plus some loan aspect no but I'll do for 10 if you say yes now it's not a fa it's not a fair question not a fair question to make us commit to that without talking we would of course it is the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make standing on that carpet is having a line in the sand at a certain valuation that is the biggest mistake they always make I'm I'm saying that we should discuss before answering without discussing but may I say something to you that's a lawyer talking not an entrepreneur cautious to have fun I'll do it for 9% what a bastard having fun you you are both Canadians there's a little bit I'm having fun with it because I think there's value here and I love to squeeze Barber's head once in a while what there's something about that 10% number that makes you feel something's worthwhile that all your effort and all your energy and all your intelligence is put into something and it's acknowledged as worthwhile I'll do it for nine no problem it's up to you barara we accept your offer smart people great Kevin we yours too I'm happy to have saved you 10% appr we much appreciate your support problem thank you congratulations guys got a goal mon

With the help of the sharks, we can make ride fresh explode. God sharks in front of you, you'll find a series of our ride fresh scents. Please feel free to crack them open and enjoy. Wow. Wow. After that, we can't even Mark, are you ? You're still over there. , what? Dumbest marketing move ever. I'm out. What? That's it. That's seriously, you got to read the room. Wrong move, wrong time. What are you upset about? Yeah. Why? What do you think? The one air pressure from the NBA is the team that beats us in the NBA conference finals. Got to know that that could that could back man. Cut it out. Yeah, I could be, but I'm not. Wow. Here's one thing I'll shout out. Before I even opened them, I picked them up and I could smell the scents. I was , \"Wow, these are obviously packed with the fragrance.\" , we pride ourselves on having some traditional scents, some non-traditional scents, but our entire approach and our entire brand is adding a cool factor to the air freshener and changing the experience. You sell any of this stuff in retail or is it all subscription direct to consumer online? , we built our business off of direct to consumer online. We proved the concept to the tune of over $1.1 million in sales. and then Thank you. Thank you. What period of time did you in three years? . Let's talk about one year this year. What are you going to do in this year in sales? This year we're going to do over $750,000. But to answer your original question, Mr. Wonderful. We've always known that the subscription was the first phase of our building our business, but the main potential and the biggest potential for us is in retail and wholesale, ? Why would you say that? Have you proven that or have you started down that alleyway? , gas stations, things that, things where it's intuitive to pick this up. Exactly. , in the in the last 6 months, we've been able to get to the final stages of an agreement with the largest automotive retailer in the country. What's the deal for? 2,000 stores, 2,000 of their 6,000 locations. In other words, they're going to order from you how many dollars of merchandise? $2.1 million in in 2023. , it's Pep Boys, that thing. Yeah, it's AutoZone. What did you sell last year? Last year, we sold $540,000 in and out of that 540 was any retail, was it all subscription? All subscription. All Why does somebody buy a subscription model for an air freshener for their car? . Yeah. , it's a convenience factor, ? Think ride share drivers, taxi drivers, these types of individuals. If I started with you, how long before I cancel? About 4 months. And how much is the subscription? , they range. , the base one is you get two a month. we have them in pairs. , and that's $8.25 with shipping. , and then the highest one. Yeah. And the highest one is $10.99. , 38 cents is our cost landed. Out of the 540,000 you did last year. . Were you profitable? Yes. Yes. What did you make? 40,000 in profit. Wow. 40,000. What were you guys doing before this? What got you here? We're we're brothers. we we're lifelong entrepreneurs. in 2014, we launched the first mobile app for black and brown emojis before they diversified the set. My brother has a successful career in sales and I was at a couple different ad agencies in my career. Yeah, we both went to Howard University, the Howard University. I then came to Los Angeles and then I got my masters at USC in entrepreneurship innovation and as as a certified in technology commercialization. I remember walking down the street and seeing all these air freshers everywhere in everybody's car and I was listen if we put some culture and style on top of this thing I already know that this market is 11 billion worldwide and United States is 300 million. yeah we could definitely do this because there's nobody doing a subscription model. That's the most interesting thing you've said in this pitch. The air freshener market is 300 million. That's interesting. I know a lot about fragrance. This is male skewed. I think you need work here in that. I think you need to have an entire femalebased line cuz I I wouldn't hang this shape in my car. It's not the investment for me. But I wish you good luck. Thank you. Thank you much. I'm out. You guys are the real deal. I've been trying to get my head around investing in you. When I was younger, my mom and dad put me in the back of a car with a million suitcases and everything. I had to sit in the back for 24 hours because my dad refused to pay for a motel. , we had to drive from Toronto all the way to Florida. All I could see was the air freshener. It is scorched into my brain. As soon as I see air fresheners, I think I never want to go back there. I'm sorry. I can't be in. I'm out. Fair enough. But let me tell you where I'm stuck at the numbers. . No one's brought this up yet, and I don't know why. $200,000 for 5% imputes a 4 million valuation on a business that makes no money. This is a business model not yet fine-tuned. I'm out. Thank you. I think you need to be congratulated for producing $700,000 in sales online. Amazing. Why you pivoting that you're going into retail? I think you're out of your mind. I don't think you realize how cash intensive it is. Why did you pivot to retail? I'm curious. Because that was all that was always the plan, ? And in the last year, the main way that we were able to grow the subscriptions and acquire those subscribers became a lot more expensive. You were losing hard in your subscription model because the numbers had changed. Yes, but we were always going to focus on growing the business through retail and wholesale. All . , I'm going to make you an offer contingent on your big deals. . . I'll take a flyer on this because I believe in the two of you. , I'll make you the offer of, of course, the 200,000, but I do want 25% of the business. Wa, that smells a lot. Let me Can I ask a question? Yes, of course. , are there other ways that you can help us in terms of a strategic partnership , in exchange for maybe 15% for the 200k? I would have to say 15% definitely not. I think this is going to be a lot of work to sell this. Thinking about 200k for 20 what? For 20%. Contingent on those two big deals. Conting on those two deals. You got it. . Good one, guys. Thank you. Thank you. You better not lose my money. Thank you much. My pleasure. ? Thank you. You did a great job. And sorry again. My weakness. Sorry. It's all good. It's all good. Congrats, guys. Nice job. I think Barber saw true entrepreneurs, grit, grind, tenacity. We were already trending upwards with these major retail and wholesale deals that trade been able to secure. And having Barber on board means that we're going to have more resources and more abilities to scale this business all the way to the top.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Trey Brown, Don Brown, Mark, Wonderful, Barber (PERSON), Los Angeles, United States, Toronto, Florida (GPE), 5%, 25%, 15%, 20% (PERCENT), French (NORP), first (ORDINAL), 24 hours (TIME)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, a lot, los angeles, a series, ride fresh, this one, the deal, the air freshener\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 imagine: day\n  \u2022 bump: track\n  \u2022 hit: you\n  \u2022 turn: car\n  \u2022 create: Ride Fresh\n  \u2022 offer: freshener brand\n  \u2022 have: wood scents grain\n  \u2022 love: one\n  \u2022 find: series\n  \u2022 think: What\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.14)\n\n**Topics:** air, year, freshener, subscription, car",

Labs the makers of Chess up we're here seeking a $300,000 investment for 5% equity share in our company wow sharks chess is a brilliant game it's great for the mind and it connects millions of people all around the world regardless of age or culture but chess has one king-sized problem it's hard to learn and once you do learn it's even harder to improve making chess an intimidating game until now chess up is chess you've never seen it before it has a built-in AI it teaches you how to play new to chess the magic is at your fingertips simply touch a a piece and you're already learning how to play chess up features a patented artificial intelligence trainer that comes with six different levels of assistance now you can learn and improve while you play and even let you play with a buddy who's halfway around the world with their moves instantly lighting up on the board in front of you for the first time ever two players of any skill level can have a balanced competitive and fun match against each other chess up is soaring to success but there's one piece that our chest set is missing a shark who's ready to make a move and capture a whole lot of cash sharks you each have a chess up that's set up and ready to play once you touch a piece for white the AI on your side will show you all the available moves ranked by strength green moves are the best and red moves are the worst then once you move the white piece the black side is going to show you where it wants you to move its piece and you can continue the game from there but it doesn't talk to you I'm making those moves but I don't understand the logic behind it there's a curated set of lessons that we have a professional chess teacher that walks you through different scenarios and teaches you different strategies that's what comes with not pertaining to this particular game over not your exact game you're playing now no I got it I'm curious how much does this cost and what does it cost you to make it full retail is $3.99 we land it here for 120 I played chess since I was 13 and I don't want to be told what I've got to do I want to play the AI we can control the level of assistance on either side you can adjust the settings on there to see the legal moves and you receive no ass why is it slow can I adjust the speed cuz I'm trying to play it quickly let us show you a video on this the board can keep up with every human movement you can play bullet games Blitz Games which are fast formats you're going to see that it's doing an automatic clock where it's keeping track of your time and the opponent's time wow that's fast that's cool wait there's a ton of online chess platforms there's a ton of software apps abolutely why would I spend $399 when a lot of them are free or ad driven or whatever online chess is incredible we connect with those platforms and you can play you play online but you're playing on a real physical board the the real difference is that you're playing on a physical board you get the tactile feel yeah learning a pre and what online misses that family experience are you doing this full-time or do you have a different job we are much full-time we met at the Innovation lab of a major consumer electronics brand between Jeff and myself we listed on over 20 patents and we're responsible for a lifetime revenue of over $1 billion can you name a product that you brought to Market that we would know sure I did most recently Garmin Lily which is a women's Smartwatch it's small and it's I wear the Garmin I love it that's fantastic perfect I took the job at Garmin in an innovation Lab in order to take a step through entrepreneurship no joke when I started that job I'd never been around all the business term I started watching Shark Tank I'm up here because of this show 3 years ago after a few hits watching these hundreds of millions of dollars for our employer and we were getting paid salaries I decided to leave I called up Adam first we started prototyping these gadgets and the best concept we had when we were working was on this chess product we took it the kickstarter and from there we had enough revenue from Kickstarter to start the company did kick we did $1.7 million in 39 days wow what were you looking to raise We've set the goal at 30,000 that is crazy you raised 1.7 million but you're asking for 300,000 for 5% 6 million valuation what are your sales we told you about the kickstarter sales that was 1.7 million since then we have not been running ads at all but we've had people trickling to the website we've sold 400,000 this year to date Adam and Jeff I want to get the ball rolling this is a business I could do nothing for you it's not my thing I'm still on Checkers and struggling thank you bar guys thank you why am I limited to the heart Hardware platform I love chess I'm going to travel I'm always taking my laptop with me now I'm going to take this I'm going to take another bag with me there's 50 million online chess players and we're not arguing that online chess doesn't have its place million yeah there's 600 million people who play over a real board I was going to say there's something about chess pieces and doing it physically to me playing chess on on a tablet feels terrible see I have no problem with the tablet guys I chess I don't love it play it when my son wants to play it to me it doesn't matter if it's Bor and it's better when it's online cuz I can be wherever I don't see it as a big enough market for me for those Reasons I'm out and what will sales be this year our sales for this year are going to be about $1.4 million are you going to make any money on the 1.4 yeah this year we'll book an accounting profit CU all the deferred revenue from the pre-sales counts towards this year do you have any debt on the company yes we have we have some debt that's into a royalty structure what is that how much there's $392,000 that gives us we give 3.92% of our sales back to that it's 3.92% of sales until you've cleaned that up that gets a 1.5 times return that sounds one of my deals yeah you're familiar with your deals during Co and getting this thing done in 15 months we went through a middleman because we can't visit the factories we manufacturing Shin in and he's taking a 20 30% cut we can drop that out almost instantly wow there's a lot of guys taking pieces of the pie in this steel but we got out quick and we're out and we're ahead of competition I'm I'm looking at it and I'm one of these on the fence deals cuz I play the game I understand what you've done it's a complicated cap table now it's complicated structure I'm going to take a pass I'm out here listen I think you did an amazing job and I think there's something important about touching and playing on a board when you're playing chess but I'm struggling because I I do wonder how am I going to make back my money if I said I wanted it for 300,000 for 10% it's a tough one it's a tough one it is can we

I'm here today seeking $400,000 in exchange for 10% of my company. Let me share a little secret with you. Women are growing tired of the gift bouquet cycle. Get flowers, watch them die, procrastinate the trip to the garbage, and then wait for the day when somebody gives her another vase full of plant carcasses. There's a better way. Introducing EcoFlower. I found a floral solution that provides my customers with a beautiful bunch of flowers that not only last forever, but are also made with recycled and sustainable materials. We create with burlap, jute, twine, bamboo, book pages, beer bottles, wine bottles, lots of other materials that create timeless gifts, stunning bridal bouquets, and decoration for your home and businesses. Sharks together, we'll captivate the hearts of the women who will start to love getting flowers again. And I got each one of you gifts that I wanted to hand out before we start. , Robert, , thank you much. Wow, fancy. This is Croatia. This would be Croatia over here. And this is Kim's home country, Australia. And this is a heart. Yeah. Sniffle. Lori, I got you one of our buffets. This is beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.

And if I don't get a deal today, you got to give it back cuz I'm a little tight on cash. Thank you much. Look at that. That's made with real money. I'm spending this. Do you individually make these, Megan? I used to make them and it got out of my hands and now it's a good sign. Yeah, we have two manufacturers that make them for us. Megan, it's pretty. But let me ask this question to the ladies up here. Lori, Barbara, if a man sent you this instead of real flowers, how would you feel about that? my. [Music] You want an honest answer? Megan, I can ask you. It's a lack of sensitivity. It's a good point. I feel I should feel precious a flower. I would rather have a real flower. Lori would rather have real flowers. Barbara would rather have real flowers. What does that say? My customers have a completely different story. I don't know what women say when you're in a wealthy community, but in the community I come from, if a man buys you flowers, spends $50 on it, you're upset with him. a lot of women are upset. They're , that $50 should have gone to towards groceries or a lot of other things. When they can keep it forever, the women cherish it more. You can prove us wrong. Here's how you can here's how you can prove us wrong. What are your sales? Lifetime sales are 2.8 million. I've only been open for a year and a half. , good for you. That's awesome. It's all direct to consumer through our website. Nice. What do you sell your bundle for? , it's about $59 for a bridal bouquet. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How did it happen that you started this business? , I saw an episode of Shark Tank and I'm , I wish I had an idea. , I called my dad and he said, remember the wood flowers that you used to sell when you were in high school? this is an idea you could do for Shark Tank. And I tried out when I was only two weeks into business. Of course, I didn't make it far. But without Shark Tank, I wouldn't have thought awesome on my path. You have a lot of competition. I know. I Nobody's selling them in the masses by the bouquets. They're for crafting. People are getting them on Etsy six at a time to put them in little hair bows for their kids, but nobody has a bouquet that you can buy online for a gift. What I can tell you is they're not used heavily in the wedding industry because people want live flowers. The industry is set up because we pass a lot of contacts. It's more and take commissions off selling flowers. I started weddings 3 months ago. Yesterday we did $100,000 in sales and 25,000 of it was weddings. Wow. What caused that? , we have a big problem at my shop with production and we purposely hold our marketing department back. But yesterday I said throw $4,000 at the ad and I want to see what you were coming up here and you wanted to brag. . . , you spent you spent $4,000 yesterday. I love her. And what was a typical day prior to yesterday in sales? A typical day is anywhere from $6,000 to 13,000. . , you created another $90,000 in sales, ? You're killing it. How much your own money is in this? $700. my god. But I have a business partner who helped me. , I was living in a one-bedroom apartment about to be homeless and I was on the news because I was trying out for Shark Tank for my first time and they did a whole news story on it. This guy saw me on TV and he called me up and he said, I want to invest. What do you need? And I'm , I need my rent to be paid and I need groceries. How much did you sell to him and for how much? He only put in $3,000 up front for inventory and then he paid my rent every month for a year. Megan, how much 25%. , hang on. He got 25% for $3,000 and paying your rent for a year. Unbelievable. Have you taken on any other investors? I tried off Shark Tank, got denied and the business was booming at this point. I was I could not keep inventory in I needed another investment. we found a local investment firm that gave us $30,000 for how much? Two guys. they each took 25%. 50% that leaves 25. you own 25%. , in total, you sold 75% of your business for roughly $35,000. That was hard times. Yes. Wow. That was a year and a half ago. Megan, one of the reasons you started a business is to retain equity, ? And you want to see it grow and that's your payback. I give you 400,000. I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. My secretary is going to own more stock than you do. That's ridiculous. You're getting wiped out. [Music] All six sharks are still in. While everyone is impressed with Megan's big sales in her faux flower delivery business, EcoFlower, they are concerned that she already gave away 75% of her company to other investors only a year and a half into her business. I give you 400,000, I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. You're getting wiped out. You sold too much stock come from. It'll come from equal shares. We have a max that we're willing to go up to. , we can't , and my investors are tech guys. This is not their area. I want to get them out at some point. And , , later want to use my money to buy them out. I don't know, which would be smart. I feel you guys would have the contacts that could make that happen. I feel that equity could be used differently with people that know my industry better. , and they're open to it. , Megan, , you've heard the saying, it's better to own 10% of a billion dollar company than 100% of a That's why I'm here. , the the challenge is it's hard to build a billion dollar business. , when you're starting out in a small business, you should try to retain as much equity as you can for as long as you can, but you have 25% ownership. You don't control the business. You don't have the final say in the business. Who am I going to get into business with? They're wonderful people. They are. You got to hang on to the equity. , I'm out. , thank you, Megan. I spend more money on flowers than I'm embarrassed to admit than most people spend on groceries. I love flowers. I don't get these. I see these all over Manhattan in bathrooms usually. I don't even understand why people buy them, honestly. I don't get it. I have to love what I invest in. Great. , I am out. . Thank you. Look at you. , amazing. Amazing. You deserve much credit, but this is not me, ? This is not my area of expertise. I'm out. Thank you. I see these readily available out there everywhere. I don't think there's You're doing a great job yourself, ? There's not competition, though. But I don't have it. I'm first and best. I don't see it as the investment for me. , I'm sorry. Thank you. It makes it virtually impossible to invest in you without diluting you to a place where you are an employee. I'm still doing a great job. There's nobody doing what I'm doing. It's not investable for me. I'm out. I'm number one in this space. Come on, Damon. I'm going to do 4 million this year. Come on. I I have the same exact concerns that the other guys have that you started this whole business to not work for anybody now you're working for the company. have you talked to these tech investors and they have they confirmed that they are willing to sell their shares as ? They're willing to share at the price for sure. I need you to be vested in this business. I want to attempt to buy them out down the road and give you a bigger piece of this business. I'm going to offer you $400,000 for 25%. [Music] Wow. That wipes you out. You'll have no equity. No, that's not what I about it. Dilutes everybody about 6%. Did you do 20% that makes us all five equal? 555 is coming from all four partners to make me a fifth partner. Yes. [Music] You got a deal. . Thank you. my god. Thank you much. Thank you. You got to stay in the business, ? You promised me. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you got a deal, too. Made me 140 bucks. my gosh.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi Sharks. I'm William and I'm Kristen. We're a husband wife dynamic duo, co-founders of Uprising Food from Cincinnati, Ohio. We're here today seeking 500,000 for 3% equity in our company. Hello Sharks. We want to revolutionize health and it starts with bread. We teamed up with the best artisan bakers in the industry to bring you the healthiest, tastiest, most powerful bread in the game. And did we mention our bread, also known as the Uprising cube, is keto, paleo, and boosts gut health? That's . And it's dairy and gluten-free. Some say it even tastes it's straight out of heaven. We've truly done the impossible. Our cubes are packed with fiber and created with clean and boosted superfood ingredients. Now, who wants to join our health revolution and bring this mouthwatering taste heaven bread to the masses? Woo! Woo! Now, who wants to taste heaven? I want to show you up here. , what we have today is for you to experience live the uprising grilled cheese. We also have French toast. And this is a plain piece of the bread, ? Yes, exactly. I want to try that, too. Go ahead, jump in. , we didn't stop at bread. We also created chips. And yes, we have sales on both. We are brand builders through and through. I worked at Proctor and Gamble and Kristen works at another CPG company. It's important to us that we bring an aesthetic and an inspiration to our brand building efforts. It's got a little bit of a sponginess to it. Almost a cake. Chewy. It's chewy. What? And what is that? What's with that? , that is designed on purpose because we want you to have a specific mouth feel with this bread. This lasts one to four weeks in the fridge. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's amazing. And that's with no preservatives. I'm going to give you a little credit for the taste cuz I've tried a lot of these products and they taste utter The bread is good. This is pretty good. What does this cost? How much? That goes for $12 there. Wo. Wo. Yes. For a little loaf of bread that. Yes, there's a lot of power in that, guys. I think the bread tastes absolutely delicious, but I can't get over the price. 12 bucks for this tiny little half a loaf of bread. , how does that compare in the market? , I want to find a $5 bill in the bread. Do what ? I don't understand that. , this is not a basic bread. We're looking to upgrade bread. Americans are frankly getting sick because of the foods that were industrialized and scaled. My father is the type of person who represents the masses. Now he's an annuity for the medical system. He was given four weeks to live. We intervened with food and my dad is still here today. When we think about what we're doing here, it's not about us being successful. It's about the mission of helping people and we will drive success by solving this problem for society. I I agree with everything you're saying and I totally agree about the disease factor. My dad died from that. same issue. Irish guy, lots of starch, lots of white flour, killed him. But not everybody in America can afford for eight slices $12. That's expensive. Yeah, exactly. What are the revenues of this business? first year in business 2019, we did 85k topline. Second year in business 2020, the pandemic hits, we did under a million topline. How's that possible? What did you do? , hold on. It gets better. It gets better. First six months of 2021, 2.1 million year to date. Pretty good. I almost want to ask you for proof. We're experts at digital marketing. , now, we can deliver a consumer for under $50 customer acquisition cost. That is a lot for what you sell because you need a lifetime customer to overcome that initial. Yeah. Bingo. It would be a lot if we weren't in such a high frequency consumable. We got to get to grips with these numbers because the sales last year were impressive. But what's your profit? We are not cash flow positive yet. We have under a million in net losses in sorry for last year. Yes, we sell a one loaf for $12 that cost us $525 to make. But let's talk shipping. Once you take that down for shipping, we clear about a 30% margin once you average our bundle together. And you make about $3.60 per loaf. Yep. 500,000 for 3% imputes a $16.6 million valuation. Explain why you're worth $16.6 million. . We're on track to do 5 million this year. As you've heard, we've done 2.1 million year to date. Other companies us, we believe can get a 6x multiple in market. But you don't make money yet. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No, absolutely not. , when do you become profitable? Ever? , we we will become profitable when we reach a certain level of scale. No kidding. You will become profitable when you reach a certain level of scale. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. All sharks are still in, but they are concerned about the lack of profits for William and Kristen's healthy bread company, Uprising Food. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No. Absolutely not. when do you become profitable? Ever. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. What is your exit strategy? Yeah, we would to either exit the company to a larger multinational or we could foresee taking this company public at some point. I don't think I've ever sat and spent this time in my seat and heard more fancy words in my entire life. All . I think if I were to put any money into your business, I would not sleep a wink tonight. Wow. . It's not even a business that I'm listening to you about. It's a cause. The uprising, the battle has begun. But the bottom line here is I don't trust you to even protect my money. And sadly for me, that's the reason I'm out. Let me tell you a quick thing. Here's I want to share a few things with you. I the concept of healthier foods, ? And I do think that down the road it will have great potential because this is on trend for what people want. But sadly, it's also too big an ask for me, your valuation. , I'm sorry. I'm out. . Thank you, Laura. Thank you. I'm stuck as an investor on this 500,000 for 3%. For this deal to work, you're going to have to exit at close to half a billion valuation for me to get my money back. I'm out. . Thank you, guys. I think the product is great. , I consider myself a foodie and definitely a bread girl. And I thought this bread was , great. But equally, I think that the, , the sign of a good entrepreneur is to know the climate that you're in. And I think for, , many years now, those of us that are in direct to consumer businesses have been able to scale our businesses and do exactly what you guys said you were going to do, chase the top line without real consideration for becoming a profitable business. You guys did not come in and demonstrate what your path to profitability is. Great point. You missed it. You spoke about all of your order economics, which ain't that great, by the way, because you're paying too much to acquire the customer. And as everybody said, you're not profitable on your first customers. , I think for me, , I'm out. Thank you. Yeah. Guys, look, why don't you run the company to be profitable now? Why didn't you go after being profitable by the month to to be able to sustain all this? That's exactly what we did, Mark. We you lost a million dollars in the journey to get here. We aggressively drove CAC to the floor. We've been the number one lowest CAC in the field. That's such a nonsense parameter. You start small. You got a nice little product and whatever you do, you go door todoor. You go online. You sell it locally and you make money and you grow. But now your back is against the wall, ? Because you're losing money on every sale. the more customers you acquire, the more money you lose unless you can make sure that you're selling them a whole lot more products and your products are expensive and the bread on sliced you get it and it's what do I do now? , you don't take a bite out of it. That crust is important to preserving the product. People buy that product for the trifecta of three reasons. You can't find something this healthy that tastes this good that's this fresh. Then why don't you say that? Why don't you say that? That was the best thing you said all day. Exactly. That was the best sales pitch you've made. The the packaging that you're looking at there is unfortunately our Gen 2 packaging before we dialed in that positioning statement and figured out that was the winning combo. You're driving me nuts. , look. We are constantly I know. . . You're overselling with all the jargon when you have an authentically good product. . Your whole little speech on crust is everything you should be saying and selling this because of that. I want a product that's going to give me all these things that I can't get from a sliced product. That's all you had to say. simplify, focus on the product, and I'm out. Thank you guys. much. Good luck with the line. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** William, Kristen, Laura, Mark (PERSON), Uprising Food, Proctor and Gamble and Kristen, CPG, CAC (ORG), Cincinnati, Ohio, America (GPE), 3%, 30% (PERCENT), French, Americans, Irish (NORP), tonight (TIME), first (ORDINAL), Gen 2 (FAC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the bread, a lot, the product, you guys, uprising food, the masses, this bread, my dad\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 do: impossible\n  \u2022 have: toast\n  \u2022 create: chips\n  \u2022 have: sales\n  \u2022 get: bit\n  \u2022 last: weeks\n  \u2022 be: lot\n  \u2022 do: what\n  \u2022 understand: that\n  \u2022 give: weeks\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.18)\n\n**Topics:** bread, product, year, money, business",

We're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, this toilet stands before you today guilty of a terrible crime. Murder. That's . This porcelain perpetrator is the number one reason people lose phones to water damage. It doesn't stop there. Toilets, swimming pools, washing machines. Each year in the US, these kill 22 million phones with water damage. We've invented a machine that can bring phones, tablets, laptops, watches, anything that fits in the chamber back to life. It's not magic. It's science. Have a look inside our machine in real time. Transforming liquid into gas. Restoring your phone in 30 minutes. No need to disassemble or take anything apart. Sharks, this is my personal phone. It has no special protection, but I'm not worried. And I'm not worried. You murderer. , let's make a deal. Sharks. This is one opportunity you don't want to flush away. gosh. I'm going to take a moment to rescue this phone and then show you our process. This is a gut-wrenching moment for customers. Bring it in for service as quick as you can. Your device starts rusting as soon as it gets wet. , inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. , I feel it's a heart attack. You got to get CPR fast, ? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. ? , technically someone could ship it to you. , are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as as we have a mail-in service. But what are your sales? last year with a few stores we did $29,000 82 stores, ? We're talking about last year. Sorry, did you say that last year you sold the incredible amount of how much? $29,000 in sales with a few stores. We focused on making the economics on a per store basis profitable. . And then we launched to 82 stores and only two months later we've been asked to launch to 600 stores. What were your sales after the balance of the stores? this year we're on track with the expansion to hit $650,000. you go to a store and you say, \"Put this in for free or do they pay you?\" , you don't pay unless it works. They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? , in the in the beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? , on average, it works out to about $80 rent a month. Wait, $80 rent per month you're charging them. And then on top of that, we get a rev share, a percentage of the revenue. What's the percentage? On average, it's about 16%. , in order to do all this, you had to have raised a bunch of capital. We've raised 2.2 million far. Wow. Wow. And what was the value of the company post money? It had a valuation cap of 4.8 million. why is your valuation high? This is about getting to $800 per month per store. That's $6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in profit. But you're not doing that today. No. But if you discount that back from when we will be doing it, that's still far above $10 million. And what do you place as a value on that risk in case you don't execute? , honestly, I see you totally as an online business. You said you have three days, , in which it can still survive. We have an online market, but we haven't been able to afford national marketing for the online. I don't understand why you think you want to go retail. I don't see the big market. I'm out. Thank you. You came in asking for a $10 million valuation and I don't know how you're going to make that back that fast. And , unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. I think technology is your enemy. I was reading something the other day that the new Apple phone is almost totally water resistant. , I think the technology improvements can put you out of business by the time you figure out your model. Wouldn't put my money there amount. Guys, look, I the idea. I the concept, but you you're going to have to keep on raising capital. And unless I gave you that capital, I'm going to keep on getting diluted. The problem is how do I get my money back? , one of the reasons I think we're going to succeed is not because we may have a good plan. It's because we have an awesome team. Have you ever heard anybody start a company, hire their people, and say, We have a horrible team. That's not enough. I'm out. , everybody's out. Mr. Wonderful's left. I the story. I understand the model. I I don't want to argue about your valuation. I think it's too high. I'm going to loan you this 500k at 13%, but I'm taking the 5% as an equity warrant. That's the value I bring as a shark to this. , I want it paid back in 36 months. What do you think of this offer? Would you be willing to go more than 500,000 now? You asked for 500. That's the deal I would do. And I'm the only shark here today willing to give you an offer. , what do you want to do? All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We'll take that deal. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. That's terrific. Thank you much. Sounds Kevin. Let's see how your new investment works. Do it, Mark. That's great. , God. All , guys. Thanks. Do it. You got to have confidence. Do it.

My name is Pamela Redmond and I'm here seeking $350,000 for 5% of my company. Sharks, we all have a name, but have you ever stopped to wonder about the impact of your name on you and your life? Kevin, let's take your name for instance. Kevin means handsome in the Irish language, but it can also mean kind, gentle, and beloved. All true. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Mr. Wonderful. Yes. And Mark, your name comes from Mars, the Roman god of war. Maybe that's where you get your competitive spirit. Lori, your name comes from the laurel tree, which is an ancient symbol of victory and honor. Maybe that's why you have such a drive to win and such a sweet way of celebrating when you do. Thank you, Kendra. Your name started out, as many female names do, as a form of a male name, Kenneth, but it's achieved complete independence, which is fitting for a solo entrepreneur who started a billion-dollar business. A Damon, your name is an old English surname that means keeper of livestock. Great she is. It's true. It's true. my god, how perfect is that for a keeper of bees? Sharks have always been fascinated by the power of names to shape our identities. That's why I started NameBerry, the world's largest website devoted to baby names. We have a 70,000 name database, thousands of lists, an active community, daily blog, and newsletter, and a revolutionary name generator called Baby Name DNA. As the premier experts in our field, we offer insights and advice to millions of name lovers and seekers every month. whether you're looking for original names, track celebrity trends, or even analyze your naming style based on your zodiac sign, we have you covered. sharks, who wants to help me reinvent baby names for the next generation? That's interesting. Thank you. That's a interesting valuation you've got there. , before you get to valuation, how do you source your data? , I have written 10 books about names starting in 1988, which is why I own all of my own IP. Wow. We've been around for 15 years. We have been profitable for 10 of those years. . , let's talk about how you make money. We make money from advertising at the moment, but you come in because we want to change that model. What's the model going to be? We want to bring AI to name. there's only two ways that can go. All this, , name generation, animology of names, the large language models are going to figure all those out across languages, ? And they'll feed and that's, , that already, ? And then the second side of it is you can sell all your information that you have to a particular large language model because they're competitive. My preference is to train our own model on our own data. We have millions of pages of information developed over 40 years. It's a singular property. then it's a question of how much are you willing to spend and it's not 300,000 or $500,000, ? To own your own model that you train yourself on unique data is is more expensive than that. Pamela, one of the big players has built a stack that you would sit on top of and they've done a lot of the hard work for you and they would take 20 30% of your revenue for providing the the infrastructure and the stack and maintain it for you. Kevin, when they do that, they're trying to steal from you, ? Of course. Of course. . And part and part of the reason I'm here is because I feel you can help us defend this singular piece of Is it defensible long term? My question then I think it is because it's internal data. It's data that only we have. . My two cents is companies will do their own where the money is for you is to license what you have to them and if you can prove to them that there's a lot of value that it'll generate a lot of responses to prompts then you can get a million5 million dollars. maybe you can help me do that. that that's a lot of work, ? And I'm not going to write you a check to do it. For those reasons, I'm out. . For me, I look at this and I think it's fascinating, but as far as a business, I feel this isn't something that I could sink my teeth into. I'm sorry. I'm I get it, Lori. I love you. And but I knew that. . , Pamela, let's go back to your business to understand why you valued it at 7 million. . , , now we're ad supported. We have 4 million unique visitors a month, 20 million page views. Last year we made 1.1 million. , and we net at 650,000. . That's not a bad living. Yeah, that's a good business. Yeah. When you look at the ads on your site, the banners that are appearing, they're around the genre of of child birth, ? Yes. . And that's generating 1.1 and it's pretty steady. Yes. , how many registered users do you have? We have a 100,000 people on our newsletter list. What's your open rate? about 50% depending on 50% on the 100,000 email. Kevin, that's better than anything you got. , yeah. By 20. I will say one thing about the data. It's hard today to capture the mother or father's name at time of birth. It's hard. You can't get it from the hospital. you there's all kinds of data scraping trying to figure out when they buy their first pampers and all this other stuff but you may be the cleanest truest source. Are you capturing all the people in any way either sell or email address? We are not doing that now. , now I have to kill you. Why aren't you doing that? It hasn't been our model. But that is something you could turn on now because that data is valuable to a giant infrastructure of companies that sell to to child birth. . I'm struggling with two things. I think that I'm struggling with how I could be a value cuz this is super tech. I'm struggling with that and how I can add value to that. And I the other thing I'm struggling with is why did my mother name me after a goat herder? , I'm out. Thank you. , what's the ownership cap table on your company? I own 66%. I have a tech partner who owns 28% and another partner who owns 5% who's non-participating partner. I I think this is cool, but this is a tech play, ? I'm not the one for you. And for that reason, I'm out. I don't think it's a tech deal. I think it's a giant negotiation between three behemoths that are developing language models. It's a interesting deal, Pamela. Here's an offer. 350,000, 33, and a third%. How about this as an offer? I will give you three times the equity, 15% for $700,000 money. Not a chance. I don't know how fast you get disrupted. That's the challenge. I would love to be in business with you, but I'm not going to give you 33%. , give me 40. The most I want to give is 24.9% because then I get to keep 50.1%. We'll do that, Kevin. Come on. , you've thought it through, Pamela. I've thought it through. All , I'll take that deal. I'll take the All . Yay. You want to do the deal? My god, I did not do that. Yes or no? Yes or no? Kevin, you got I think that's brilliant, Kevin. You're You're too interesting. Nice to meet you. That is good. Congrats, Pamela. That's awesome.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 350,000, billion-dollar, 300,000 or $500,000, My two cents, 700,000 (MONEY), Irish, Roman (NORP), Mars (LOC), English (LANGUAGE), Baby Name (PRODUCT), AI (ORG), second, first (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** your name, a lot, a business, a name, baby names, child birth, an offer, the age-old question\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 have: name\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 have: name database\n  \u2022 offer: insights\n  \u2022 analyze: naming style\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 source: data\n  \u2022 write: books\n  \u2022 make: money\n  \u2022 be: ways\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.28)\n\n**Topics:** datum, model, kevin, name, business",

over there that's much better our company is Ash in Anvil and we're seeking $100,000 in exchange for 12 1/2% of our company as you can see we're short us shorter guys have a tough time finding shirts that fit we're forced to either buy custom clothes tailor everything we purchase or do something that boost the old self-esteem shop in the kids section to get the fit look at the shirts we're wearing today these shirts do not look good the sleeve and body lengths are too long the neck is too big and overall fit doesn't work awful these are these are normal clothes made for guys them not for guys us these are the only available options for shorter guys now let's try Ashen Anvil wow all now I know what you're thinking but no we're not models but our everyday shirt will sure make you feel one it fits much much better the lengths are correct and the shirt fits a shorter guy me sharks with your investment we can continue to go our sales the heights we can only dream of and Achieve our goal of keeping grown men everywhere from shopping in the kids section thanks guys we're all set watch your head on the way out R some shirts today if you'd to take a look all thank you Eric Robert here you go Lori thank you Ash an thank you shorter guy clo got it guys Is it wise to Brand it shorter guys clothes given the stigma you spoke about you tell us Kevin excuse me I'm of medium height we thought a ton about how do we brand this do we say vertically challenged do we say not tall what's the best way to do it and we ended up with shorter guy clothes cuz we were sick of trying to beat her on the bush why is it called Ash an anvil Ash comes from Detroit City's motto we will arise From the Ashes and Anvil is a tribute to the manufacturing Legacy of Detroit that's cool cool thanks Stephen I'm a tall guy's shorter guy's height when we did our studies and did a ton of fittings to get our style down guys that were 5'8 and Below fit better in our clothes than traditional ones what are you saying I'm short because how old are you I'm 5'6 myself 5 fo8 myself yeah our average customer is 5 fo5 let me see I'm 5'8 you're 5'8 you're not 5 look the heels look at the heels I'm 5 56 I don't know Dam get off your toes Dam you are not 5'8 my friend you are not I told people I was 5'7 for years I'm 5'8 I'm 5'8 you're 5'8 yeah Damon You' shrunk I'm 5'8 not anymore you're not what do you got in sales since launching 9 months ago over $130,000 of sales far after N9 months months that's not horrible that's on our website 100% And we sold out twice it's all online everything's online 100% tell us you sell those shirts for what are your margins all the business stuff yep our shirts retail for $79 and our margin now it's about 55% we first designed our fit we went on the streets and found hundreds of shorter guys and said hey come over to our apartment have a beer try on protyp go it worked it worked they came over they tried on prototypes looked at every little detail things the collar and the tail drop the cffs it's always smart to go ask people what are their thoughts to get feedback that's why social media is great today what do you guys need our biggest challenge now is inventory how do you acquire the database of 55 guys how do you find that customer it's an interesting challenge it's a subset of a subset subset Market because because I'm way out of your target market how big the Mark is the market is what he's trying to say if you look at it there's one and three American men are 5'8 and under which represents over 40 million adults in the us alone that's why I always felt that I was a little shorter than the average Siz person because Kevin's around my height Robert's around my height way taller you understand what I'm saying you're telling me I was walking around with this problem that I never realized I had and I think this is for a man who wears his shirt outside of his pants then of course it looks baggy I always wear my shirt inside on pants I think you're too -dressed for most of America if you look at clothes now you could buy a suit and short I know I wear a 40 short suit everything else is small medium large and it's made for a 6ot guy we're selling clothes that are more everyday and casual I think it's a clever idea I think you guys are for doing a good job thank you not my line of clothing it doesn't fit me I'm out thank you we have clothes that guys love we have 900 happy customers that want to buy more shirts it's about financing enough to meet that demand and preparing for new products and we haven't even talked about things jeans chinos shorts Master what you're doing first and you guys are smart you're doing everything but for me I don't think I'm the partner for you for that reason I'm going out thank you we've looked at Brands destination Xcel and Lane Bryant who led the way for plus-sized women's and big and tall men you have plus-sized women and petite women you have big and tall men and then there's nothing even though a third of us are short I'm puzzled on how to Market it accurately and I I think it's an emotional thing as I don't want to accept the fact that I need special clothes probably but you still need them this is not for me I'm out thank you Kevin and Mark what are you doing Mark we're sold out and guys continually come to us wanting to buy shirts and again the biggest challenge is inventory once we get more inventory and we know we can do it no guys I it I your focus on it I think there's a niche opportunity there I'll make you an offer 12 12% is not enough I'm going to have to get the 25% but I'll offer you $150,000 for the 25% that's my offer it's not a negotiation it's not a let me see what Kevin has to say it's a yes or no conversation we appreciate the offer would love to work with you we spent a lot of time getting to this point can we hear what Kevin has to say first nope wise man wow your call guys bird in the hand 100 50,000 25 I'll do the the 100K for 15% you [Music] think I'm out guys if you're in we'll take the [Music] offer you're lucky I you wow you're lucky you nice Moon W the tall guy working with a short man I love it maky my pleasure guys next time when you get a yes take it we will thank you you almost lost that deal the serious World boys thank you guys thanks guys wow we could become the first big company for shorter guys and there's a lot of us out there that are looking for clothes we do have a chip on our shoulder and we're underdogs Detroit's the underdog City shoulder guys are underdogs and we're an underdog company but we're going to

I'm from Bethesda, Maryland, and I'm asking $200,000 for 5% of my company, Smart Girls. Sharks. We can all agree that the latest robots and drones are super cool, but let's face it, it's a boys market and it's not of interest to girls. In addition, in the US, we have a major shortage of engineers in male-dominated workforce. , how do we encourage more girls into science, technology, engineering, and math? We show them how fun technology can be by integrating it into the toys they already play with. I would to introduce you to Smart Girl Sigi, the world's first coding robot for girls. [Music] Hi guys. Hello. Super cute, huh? , Smart Girl Siggy is a selfbalancing hoverboard that carries any 11in fashion doll. You can connect with it with any smart device, including phone and tablet. Using our sugarcoated proprietary app, you can start coding with a touch of a button. Today, our smart girls are going to show us a dance they coded using our sugarcoated appet. [Music] Me and my girls take it on the world. Make it world. We can take over the world. We've been waiting. But it's mag. [Music] That was amazing, girl. Good job, girls. Good job. sharks, who's going to join me and make all girls smart girls? Can I come? if you want to come on up, we will show you how to code. how does it work? And as I mentioned, Siki carries any 11in fashion doll. we made you a Richard Branson doll. Here you go. And you all we have Shark Tank dolls for all of you. Shall we give some samples to the sharks? If I may say, it's flattering. It looks about 20 years younger. you look good there. Thank you. It's fantastic. Oo, I this. Look how buff I look. , look at Robert. Yes, I look Matt Damon. Wow, Lori, you look amazing. That's you. And and we put you in a gorgeous velvet suit. That's me with hair. , Charie, the siggy is the segue Exactly. This is cool. , we're doing puzzle one and it says to move 50 cm forward at 25% speed. you are going to change the speed by tapping here to 25. Yep. And next change the amount of centimeters from 25 to 50. 50. And now you are going to drag and drop the codes. First the speed. . And next we're going to drive on floor to see if we got it . And now how to code. Yay. You did it. You're such a geek, Richard. You're great teachers. Thank you. How old are you? I'm 10. You're 10. And I'm nine. And do you find it easy or hard to do? It's easy. Sometimes for a beginner, you can find it hard, but when you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. To what degree can they if they get more advanced, can they enter the commands? Yeah, we've allowed for kids to also see the code that they've made. you can see the JavaScript you've created. it's learning your ABCs before you start, , writing novels. How did you come up with this idea? My daughter was struggling in math. I was , what can I do? And then I walked into her room and I I saw this line of dolls and I thought, can I connect robots and dolls together and make something that's more inspiring for her? And and that's how Smart Girls was created. That was two years ago. And what was your next step to do that? . , making something self-balancing is difficult. That's why you had to get it moving first. Yeah. Exactly. And we spent almost a year doing the mathematics on this. And our significant e-learning platform app, Sugarcoated, is special in the sense that we put girls in the center. It's story based. And did you release this onto the market yet? We've only been on the market for less than 6 months. . And we've done $250,000 worth of sales in that short period of time. How did you get your sales? the first thing that I did was I went to the World's Toy Fair with six prototypes. I walked away with 300 names of different companies who were interested in the product and I thought, what, this is going to this is going to be big. then I started to talk to some of them and I was able to get some distributor agreements and that helped me raise the funds. the 250,000 is from one distributor, a couple of distributors. It's for distributors, also direct from retail, also from Amazon. where is it now, Sherman? Where can I see the It's available online on our website. What does it sell for? I don't think we ever asked you. Yeah, it sells for $79.99. And what does it cost you to make it? About $18 landed. Wow, that's great. Let us know why you think the company's worth $4 million at this point. One of the things is how difficult it is to do the balancing algorithm and it makes it special. We can license or sell the balancing algorithm. It's unique. I tell you that self balancing thing is cool. Doesn't it look Richard met Lori? , hey, you want some tea? Is this a patent on this? This this We have a provisional patent on our product. , I think this is valuable because out of the young ladies that do go into engineering, 70% end up dropping out of engineering because they don't have other females. they can relate to. And I think if you get them in early enough, they will have more females. I'm interested in licensing this thing out, but you're asking a lot. I would have to give you the 200,000 for 30%. All sharks are still in. Damon is interested in Smart Girls, an engineering toy geared towards girls, but he wants a much bigger stake of the company than the 5% Charie came in offering. I would have to give you the 200,000 for 30%. . Wow, that's that's a lot. , , been in the toy business, the Barbie doll, the 800 lb gorilla in that business. Sales have declined the last couple of years, but they're still , one is sold every 3 seconds, there's nothing to connect with them. I applaud what you're doing, but the incarnation of that idea is this doll. And I think it's it's tough. It's a tough tough business to be in. , yeah, I don't want to go back into it. I'm out. Let me tell you what I think. I did a deal with Robert that was a doll that had imperfections, cellulite, and one eye that's crooked and, , all these things normal people. What happened is that Barbie came out with the exact same thing. crushed us. , this is a completely different business. If you go to the toy store today in the robotic section, there is not one toy that's specifically aimed at girls. Such a smart idea, but I think that Damon's licensing offer is the smartest thing cuz he's expert at that. I have to be out. It's great when you're learning things and you don't know you're learning things. , you're playing. Yeah, exactly. Obviously, all of us would love our kids to to learn to code. I I love what you're doing. I think it's it's great. But I don't think I can add enough value to your business to invest. sadly, I'm out. . Retail is brutal. I everything about your company except the fact that you have a product that's in retail. You're still vulnerable to every new product that comes in trying to teach robotics slashprogramming slash whatever to girls. I'm out. Damon, you were 200,000 for 30%. Yeah. Is there any wiggle room in that? , the challenge is, let's talk industry standard. A normal licensing agent is normally around 25 to 35%. They don't pay you anything. They get it and go represent it. I'm paying you 200,000 to go out and license it. Make him a counter offer. Charie, what's your downside? Would you come back with 20%. You won't regret it. We will do a great job for you. I am dedicated to this. I'm planning on the licensing part. I'm going to have to stay at 30 25. We're meeting for $200,000. Yeah. Yeah. For us to go in licensing? Yes, it is. You got a deal. Yeah, thank you much. Congratulations. You sold it. done, kids. Congratulations. Byebye.

We're a fatherdaughter duo from upstate New York. We're here today seeking a bite-size investment of $250,000 for 10% of our company, Tikmitt, where we're not afraid to tick off ticks. Sharks. Ticks are small, nasty bugs that can do a lot of harm. They carry potentially life-threatening diseases, including Lyme disease. Before tick, the only option for prevention was a bottle full of chemicals whose names you can't pronounce. That's disgusting. Or tweezers. Ow. But they're only good after they embed. And then you're playing Russian roulette with your health. That's why we created TickMint, the ultimate tick check accessory. It finds and removes even the tiniest ticks from yourself, your loved ones, and your pets before they embed and transmit diseases. wipe TikT over your skin, your clothes, your pet's fur, and TikT will remove any loose ticks. Then place Tikmitt in the included dryer bag in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill the ticks. And Tikmitt is ready to be used again. With our big dogs, it was a challenge keeping ticks out of the house. But with Tikmitt, I no longer have to worry about ticks hanging out on the couch with me watching Shark Tank. Ew. Tikmitt provides a simple solution for families to enjoy the outdoors safely. sharks, who wants to help us scale tickmitt worldwide and make every adventure worry-f free? Those are your samples in front of you. We have five different colors. How does such a soft fabric this remove the ticks? it works on the theory of velcro. Ticks are all hooks. This is a patented microfiber. , the loop sizes is what the patent is around. if the loops are too big, the ticks don't get stuck in it. If they're too small, they can't get in at all. , it's designed to work on ticks that are, , nymphs to adult and all different species. How did you even come think that that was a possibility? , when I was seven years old, I started having bad arthritis in my knee. I couldn't walk and eventually I got a bad rash on my face and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. And it wasn't until my dad said to the doctor, \"Hey, we live in an area with ticks.\" I ended up testing positive for Lyme disease, went through about six months of physical therapy and have made a strong recovery because we caught it pretty early and since then we've always been concerned about it. we started working with a tick scientist and a product engineer and after 13 iterations we came up with this product. Isn't there a pill that's supposed to repel them? Yes. the way that the pill works is it's an oral medication you give to your dog monthly. , if a tick does bite your dog, it means that your dog's not going to get sick. But again, it doesn't stop the tick from coming into your home or getting into your car. Yes. But can you do everything ? , don't most people miss things. , you can capture most of it, but how do you make sure you're comprehensive? We've been working with a tick scientist, and it picks up between 90 and 95%. There's always a chance you're going to miss one. We're not making that claim that you're getting 100%. I never wanted to know this much about TI, but what we want to know is, is there a business here? Yes, there is a business. , we were recently at the outdoor retailer trade show and on 137 submissions, we won innovation product of the year. That has led to 70 conversations with big box stores, which means you're ready to talk about the business. That's . , we've been in business 18 months. We've done 432,000 in sales. Wow. Good for you. , what have you done year to date? 252 this year. You are the tick whisperer. The tick chick. What What's your background? I'm the classic entrepreneur. Dropped out of college, started businesses. My last business was a business called Magnolia Bakery in New York City, one store, and took it to 14 countries and then sold it. next to Radio City Music Hall. That's it. And I'm an only child to a family of entrepreneurs and I went to school for entrepreneurship, worked in finance for a couple of years. then you went tick crazy. , I was already a little bit tick crazy before that because of the lime scene. , , a classic entrepreneur in the back of my head is that's a business one day. , I wanted to go back to business, Steve, cuz I'm freaking out about your valuation. You're not worth two and a half million bucks. You don't even I'll tell you why. We've already got our patent and our IP filed in Great Britain and EU. are about to launch in 15 countries. Was this the utility patent that you were and design? Yes, both. , you have to file in each country and in each country it's thousands and thousands of dollars and then certain countries it takes 20 years to get the patent. Patent pending gives you the protection until you get it. But patent pending doesn't technically give you any protection. But what we found going to all of these shows, we've learned how big the problem is worldwide. And there's also a huge occupational hazard. people who are firefighters, policemen, land surveyors, and the Boy Scouts of America. Steve, how much do you own money do you have invested? Over 600,000. Wow. Damn. what do you sell them for? What do they cost you to make? 164 to make, 215 landed. Sells for $19.99. , there's some margins there. 70% of our sales this year have been between Amazon and our website. Half and half. 15% has was wholesale and distribution. And then we also did a flash sale. You know your stuff. But this was the first year we went to shows. It was eye opening. First it showed us it was a worldwide market. We have 10 shows lined up next year and every You can't do shows. This should be all over social media. We have about 6,500 followers, but we're getting, , almost a million impressions a month. We had a video go viral. It has 7 million views. Hey, hey guys, let me get it started. Look, I can't think of anything better in life than starting a business with your daughter, ? I get to see her all the time. But let me tell you guys, wherever there's ticks, I'm going the opposite direction. I'm the tick avoider. It's not a fit for me. Congratulations. I love to see it. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you. You must be incredibly proud of her. She's bam, bam, bam. Every question, every answer, it all. The hard thing for me is my company bug bite thing. They want to get into the tick space. And the problem is I have to remain loyal to them. I think you're going to do great though. I wish you great success, but I'm out. Thank you. We appreciate it. We understand. I think it's a great product. I question how many people going to use it because I forget about all that stuff when I go in the house. , it's not for me. I'm out. , understand. Thank you. I'm a perfect tick girl. I almost lost my son to Lyme disease when he was two and a half. Wow. I didn't know what was wrong. High fever, hardly breathing, I know the dangers of it. I also have had many ticks myself. If I'm not feeling , I assume I have a tick. Exactly. Yes. Would you take 250,000 for 30%. No. 20. I think that's a little bit higher than we wanted to go. We would do it for 20. 30. It's a lot of work, let me tell you. We know. To get all the deals at the big box stores, to keep your eye on them, to the chargebacks, it's not satisfying work. But 30% is too rich for us. That's a no. It's a no. I would look at this deal, but there it's not a company yet. It's a product. And , how do I get my 250 back? I don't want to tie up 250,000 for 10 years while we wait for what? Tick mitt public listing. I don't want to tie up my money for 10 years. , I'm I'll make you an offer. You may not it, but it's the only way I would do this deal. I do the 250 for 20% a buck a unit as a royalty, I get some a distribution. Where does it end? I can't have it in perpetuity. The margins on the distributors would make that too tight. What about leave the royalty in place until I get back 2 million? That's an eight time multiple. That doesn't make sense. Why not? Makes sense to me. Of course it does. Yeah. , that's I would invest with you if you gave me that deal. I , look, I've structured zillions of deals this on single products and I would do that deal 250,000 20% a buck a unit till I make I make back 2 million bucks. Thank you. But that won't work for us. Am I clear and understanding that you weren't interested in my 250? Yeah. Or 30%. Would Would you do it for 25%. No. We're not We cannot get to 30. No. I'm out. Thank you. I think these offers reflect how nissent and how early this is. Maybe we're not telling the story enough. No, you are fully understand. I believe you are the tick kings. I believe that. It's we know how much work is involved. No, I I get that. . , you don't my offer, I understand. You don't have to take it. I'm out. Good luck, guys. We appreciate the effort.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nFirst into the tank is a tool that brings kids imaginations to the next level. Hey Sharks, I'm Ky and I'm Max. We're from Philadelphia and we're looking for $250,000 for 5% of our company. Now, sharks, we all know that a child's creativity knows no bounds. , look, I'm a cardboard knight. Luckily, I'm a cardboard astronaut with a jetpack. And that stack of sturdy cardboard boxes from all the stuff that we've bought online is perfect to be upcycled for kids art projects. But when it comes to working with cardboard, the tools for kids, don't cut it. Scissors. We love you, but stick to paper. , box cutter. Not till you're older. Much much older. That's why we created the Chompsaw, the kids safe power tool for cutting cardboard and building 3D models with ease. Because what kid wouldn't want to use a power tool this to make awesome stuff this? Now, the chompsaw works a fast hole punch, which intercepts cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. , Sharks, who's ready to help inventors of all ages unleash their creative potential and cut a deal with the chomp saw? That's pretty cool. I love it. Yeah. , each of you sharks, you have a sample in front of you of our chomp saw. And we'd love for each of you to try cutting out. , when a kid inevitably touches it, what happens? Let me show you. If I try shoving my finger, even if you take the cardboard out, nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Cool. , my suggestion while you're cutting, try and follow the black lines. You look what you're doing. I do not. Now, what's happening here? Now, why isn't it going curving when I turn it? a band saw, if you push this, you have to twist the cardboard. And now you can get nice curves, that. . . Hey, did you say this was for 44 year olds? Yes. It's for kids of all ages. Kids of all ages. Voila. , yeah. Beautiful rock. The kids love it a lot, but every time a parent gets their hands on it, they can't get enough. Yeah. Fun to do, though. Let's go. All . Yeah. All . Yeah. Wow. What's super great is you're taking the cardboard box. Yes. And then creating everything, , anything from a sword to a fish to a castle to whatever. do you send instructions on these different projects? Absolutely. it comes with a simple user manual which explains you how to get started but our website is chock full of special instructions. We are also in the process of developing a monthly subscription for cardboard projects. Every month kids will receive any little materials that they need to complete the project and they'll follow different themes that teach different STEM concepts. I love how you're staying in character too. It's fun to hold. What is the age group that this is intended to? Our target market is eight plus, and that's mainly due to the compliance requirements for products for kids younger than eight. I'm not going to say you can't operate it, but we highly would recommend parental supervision while you do that. I do have a son who is three. He's our number one marketing star. he has blown us up on social media, videos of him operating this tool himself. what I love about this? Everything today is about tablets and computers and phones and this takes you back to the basics of being able to work with your hands and be creative. And people are going back to that. the youth want tactile things and experiences and you have the supply because of the boxes. Exactly. Yeah. 250,000 5% of a $5 million valuation now that we understand exactly what the product does. And by the way, I would say I made the best shark. beautiful. That's a good exercise. Thank you much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. But let's talk about sales because you better have some. Yeah. , we launched less than a year ago for pre-orders only. We haven't delivered our product yet. And in the less than a year since we've launched, we've sold $2.1 million. Is that a Kickstarter or? We originally launched on Kickstarter. We raised close to $1.2 $2 million last October and since then we've raised an additional almost a million dollars. And you haven't delivered a unit yet, ? We haven't delivered any units yet. How many do you owe? We sold close to 10,000 units far. And what price have you put on them? they cost $230. Wow, it's expensive. And how close are you to delivering? Yeah, we'll be shipping them out in about a month. I'm returning our factories in China. I will be back there next weekend to oversee the last production test run of a thousand units. your whole company ride is on the line when you go back to China pretty much. What do they cost you to make? It it costs us 73.81 to make. you're only going to be selling these direct to consumer. now we only sell direct to consumer. But once we have inventory, we want to start to explore. March is not enough to put retail in the middle of this. Kelsey, how did you come up with the idea? Yeah. , I came up with the idea, Max and I both met doing our master's program of product design at the University of Pennsylvania. , and I came up with the idea during a class for that program and the goal was teaching kids design thinking skills and we use cardboard often. We got to the prototyping stage. I realized that working with cardboard is difficult for kids as much as they love it. And have you guys raised money before? We've raised a a total of $5,000 in safe agreements from family members. What valuation? Doesn't matter. It's $5,000. I'm interested if you told him it was worth something at the time. God, I hate safes. Why do you hate safes? Because it's terrible for investors. For the investor, there's no IOU. Hey, I promise to give you equity at some point in the future. With no cap, no interest rate, no discount. , it's ridiculous. A safe note is a piece of paper that means nothing. It's not debt a convertible noted. Sorry, we're going on a tangent on We appreciate that, but I don't how mainstream it is. I don't know why everyone's doing it. All , look, I'll take a flyer on it. There's a bunch of question marks, particularly around production, and we don't have any reviews on the final product shipped. Yeah. , I got to reflect that in my offer. I'll give you the 250,000 for 20%. What's your lead time now? Starting with nothing, it's about 17 weeks. . , that's your biggest challenge, ? It is our biggest challenge because you have uncertainty about your demand. You have uncertainty about the different platforms where you can sell and you have 12 to 17 weeks to turn it around. You can't boom boom boom if we got an order from retail. They need a lot of work. Look, I think you guys are great founders to back. It's too early for me. , I'm out. Understood. Thank you. My accolades to you, Kelsey, in particular. You're rock solid. I'm going to make an offer from 250 for 20%. That's my offer. Same offer. Same offer. We have to decide who you want to work with. It's early with me, but with complete belief because I know people you always product's going to work, but I think it has to get to retail, too. Got two offers. Yes, we do. what? I'm going to make you an offer. One shark is out. Barbara and Kevin have each offered 250,000 for 20% of Kowy and Max's cardboard saw for kids, Chop Shop. But Mark may also be interested. what? I'm going to make you an offer. You have risk obviously in manufacturing, but you guys are product designers, physical product designers. , that whole process. You'll figure that. Your next biggest challenge is pricing. You have good margins, but you don't know how much you're going to sell, but more importantly, you don't know what's involved on the marketing side to get the sales that you want, ? And , I think you're going to have an opportunity to raise your prices. , I think you're going to have a ton of margin. And I think if you do this , it is the hot product of Christmas. And I know in your mind you're already thinking that way, ? But you've got to get it in front of the people. And I think that that's where I can help. what's your offer? , you guys asked for 20%. ? and that's probably too much. I'll ask for 15%. I'll give you the 250K for 15%. Say yes or no now and we have a deal. 250K for 15%. Yeah. This is more than you wanted to give. I know. But 85% of a watermelon is a whole lot better, ? If you would take the 15%, I would go in with Mark. ? . 15% split between the two of you. . Yep. Because I think you have a lot more coming. I heard you. I listened to you. I love how badass you are. 250,000. Mark and I for 15%. That's an amazing offer. Don't get caught up in a couple percentage points, ? I know when you walk in the door, everybody's got that number, ? But I'm telling you, between the two of us, the ability to scale and do it quickly and have questions answered for everything and because we've both been there, we'll save you that delta. , what do you guys think? I think Mark and Lori, you have a deal. Thank you much. Let's cut this up. Thank you much. Super stars for sure. All . Thank you much. You got this. , happy about this. Thank you. Don't leave me hanging. Thank you much. See you guys. Congrats, guys. Thanks much. Thank you.

$400,000 in exchange for 10% equity in our company all sharks who wants to take a shot with me shot take a shot shots we put shots down in front of you see who's Brave shot ready cheers it's apple cider vinegar as you guys know by now that was a shot of apple cider vinegar my god I started drinking apple cider vinegar or ACV to detox and lose weight I loved the way it made me feel but the taste was strong we created mother beverage mother beverage is an allnatural sparkling probiotic drink made with organic fruits and herbs and most importantly apple cider vinegar they're light crisp refreshing and the best part there's only 2 to four g of sugar per bottle what do you say sharks are you ready to try the best tasting apple cider vinegar drink you've ever had your I'm still dying we've got some samples here for you today yeah you better something to compare to this is much better you had you should have warned us though yeah it's strong you can have this shot would you another I think I'm all thank you much I'll take one of these lovely beverages though thank you it doesn't taste as crappy as the shot it tastes sugary soda that's the idea our top sellers are lime Ginger raspberry Rose our pineapple turmeric and blueberry Sage how much apple cider vinegar is in here there's a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar what will that do for you there's a ton of great health benefits to Apple cider vinegar Alison has a personal story about that she started drinking it to detox and to lose weight if you dilute ACV does the function of the apple cider vinegar still stand or is it pretty much you've sub they recommend to dilute it because if you take it straight it's hard on your esophagus and it's hard in your stomach ours is fully unpasturized you want to make sure it still has all the health benefits intact we've prepared a pre-made healthy go-to option to get your daily dose of app advertised exactly tell us about tell us about the business we started about 18 months ago our lifetime sales are about $500,000 what are you going to make this year all all in we're projecting a million dollars we received placement in over 200 locations in a large National Grocery chain is it Whole Foods we are in Whole Foods locally in the Dallas Fort Worth area but it was Albertson how much is this bottle retail it retails for $2.99 to$ 359 based on the Retailer's margin what's the cost to make the product the cost is anywhere between 78 cents and 85 sent a bottle all in that's pretty good for the volumes you have the only way I get out of this thing alive is somebody buys you at some point there's an exit yes sir and that that exit in beverage seems to be at around 50 million when you establish some regional market share the big guys come and take you out as opposed to doing this themselves cuz what you're doing there's nothing proprietary about this anybody can knock you off but we happen to have an expert here who built billion doar brands in beverage let me ask a question tell me why these two are not beverage cockroaches going to get crushed by big guys who want that shelf space back the big guys what they've done is they have subcontracted Innovation to the entrepreneurs of America few brands are being launched by the big beverage companies today they're not cockroaches they have a chance of survival people want to drink beverages that they feel better about in this space the first thing is do you have a functional story we do have a great story we both worked in oil and gas before we did this and I was having a ton of health issues I kept going to different doctors I was sluggish bloating skin problems finally I read online that drinking apple cider vinegar could help with a lot of those problems within 2 weeks everything had subsided but I could not get over the taste I went back to my kitchen and created this we started selling at farmers markets and the Whole Foods buyer tried our product at the farmers market and said you guys have to be in Whole Foods are you now full-time into the vinegar deal how much have you invested currently we've raised about $125,000 at what valuation that was at a $600,000 valuation that was now you're million that was pre- Revenue based on concept that was friends and family a majority of that money was to start our production facility you manufacture this yourself yes sir how big can you get on your current manufacturing footprint 60,000 bottles a month but we do we have already started to finance a fully automated bottling line and this will take us up to $200,000 why would you want to be in the manufacturing business I that's what I'm I can't believe you guys that's a disaster it keeps our cost down we are able but you're in the mud you're in the weeds why would you want to be in the manufacturing business I that's what I'm I can't believe you guys that's a disaster it keeps our cost down we are able you're in the mud you're in the weeds the reason that we don't copack we wanted to keep it raw and unpasteurized I will tell you that if I did not do a deal in my cocktail business I would have gotten swallowed everybody did copy me by nowbody copied me and I knew I needed muscle and distribution you need to come in hot and hard and fast and you need a partner cuz you're still in the kitchen you're not even at Phase zero where you have someone else doing it for you you need to get the hell out of the kitchen and you need to start a business not an artisanal mom and pop beverage business I'm out you're not fully cockroaches yet you're s of larva you're starting and it's early and you haven't gone through any of the pressures of marketing by the big guys as they give you shell space the thing is is with little marketing we have the points of distribution every beverage guy comes in here and the future is bright we got to wear shades but you're still vinegar roaches the valuation is insane I'm out yeah the problem is there's no such thing is a little marketing the hard part is the scaling part and taking people's attention and sales away from other products you're going to have to raise a lot more money after this and that's the part I'm concerned about and as much as I I would love to help a Dallas company I'm out thank you I it it's great that it's low calorie my only concern is struggling with the Competitive Edge I see your vision but I don't think that you have gotten there yet for me I'll be a customer but I won't be a partner I'm out thank you for that there's one shark left then there was one and in the beverage business but I'm not smart enough to have created my own beverage ever I find Smart entrepreneurs and I partner with them and they're the ones who had the vision for the brand but I become the number one consiliary for them I'm going to give you an offer whoa Kitty going to give you an offer but the valuation is not what you going want it to be beverage is Savage as best thing you'll tell you I'll tell you it's Savage the mathematics for a company that this year has done 250 if we take it 12 months you're at 360 let's even round it up to $400,000 that puts you at a 1.6 odd million valuation for $400,000 for me to get interested it's got to be more 25% guys that is ridiculously good offer for you I would have never run aief in the night intriguing you you have to take [Music] that take it we

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nnext up a Latin American food staple that the entrepreneurs hope will be big in the United [Music] States hola sharks I'm MAF and I'm her sister coko we're originally from kakas Venezuela and together we found it toasted we're here today seeking $100,000 in exchange for 5% equity in our business sharks when we moved to the US from Venezuela we spent years craving Great South American food but we couldn't find authentic and convenient options in the market and that is why we decided to create toasted a brand of better for you Latin American food Staples that are ready to eat in under 10 minutes we decided to focus on a South American classic Thea it is a cornmeal bread that is crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside and perfect for stuffing with your favorite fillings we offer different flavors from Chia flax seed to Yuka to our original corn recipe all with zero added sugars and trans fats with three to four grams of protein per serving and they're also gluten-free sharks the Hispanic Community is the fastest growing minority in the US and the love for Hispanic food it's mainstream Across America who's ready to join us in becoming the go-to brand for great and authentic Hispanic food all sharks let's try some samples yeah I'm starving but we have here today our original Aras they're filled with sweet plantain and queso blanco we also have the Chia flaxy vas with some guacamole and our Cava or Juka Aras with some mozzarella cheese this is good thank you much this is the classic with the cornmeal it's a bread that you can do anything with you can stuff it with all different fillings or you can top it as a toast is that kept refrigerated or Frozen our products are frozen but are you already in stores this is real packaging you already on shelves cor we are currently in about 900 stores including Publix Walmart we recently got distribution at Whole Foods Markets and wind Dixie all the Central Market in Texas wow tell us a little bit about your background we're both originally from Venezuela we mentioned with sisters we moved to the states about 80 years ago because of the political and social turmoil that the country is still currently facing and looking for better opportunities for ourselves we worked hard to get a good education and start our corporate careers here I started working one of the largest cpg companies in the US and my sister started her career in the banking industry but there was something or a feeling between the two of us we were missing a part of our culture and our traditions and specifically our food and we started thinking between the two of us what we could innovate and we started experimenting with recipes in our own homes while keeping our full-time jobs we came up with with the first skiu which is the traditional ARA that is ready to toast in 5 minutes did you have any background in manufacturing Foods at all nothing we knew nothing what do you sell them for how much do you make them for what's the revenue let's talkn last year were 200,000 this year we've made about 190,000 in 5 months you think you'll get to 400 this year we're going to get about to 500,000 by the end of this year we sell them for 323 is Blended of the four skus it cost us 230 our gross margins are 30% after a little light a little light on the gross margins after selling and distribution expenses is 20% that's not good enough what are you going to what are you going to do to fix that packaging we already have a deal to reduce packaging by half and in ingredients there's a lot of opportunity to bring cost down and do you have competition not in the Frozen aisle there are other areas sitting in the in the in the refrigerated aisle I the product I got to tell you why I'm not a diabetic but I monitor my glucose I I wanted to try this root one it didn't spike it I found a bread I can eat thank you for bringing that up that's amazing this is a solution for me and lots of other people that diet the way I do we don't eat gluten and The Taste is phenomenal thank you I love to invest I love to invest in stuff that I use I I I don't know how you're going to make any money with these crummy margins this is the first year that we're going to be profitable but have you paid yourselves anything no that's the thing we haven't been paying ourselves look it's a flyer I'll give you the 100 Grand I want [Music] 20% there's only one Mr wonderful thank God for that but Mr Wonderful you're cting a valuation by one you're valuing at 500,000 I know that and that's what we're going to make this year it's unfair to Val time sales Mak sense to me for a commodity guys I'll simplify things to help you figure things out look it's a great product getting to 200,000 sales with the distribution you have from where you've started is phenomenal it's not something that I get excited about even though the product is amazing for those Reasons I'm out thank you much we appreciate it I love this but my concern was refrigerated trucks cost a lot now there's not a lot of space in those grocery stores and for you to get where you have gotten I have no idea how have you done that I will be purchasing this but I'm out thank you Dam thank you much Damon I think you're impressive and thank you much you two are Mighty you have gotten into five major retailers in the shortest amount of time it's fantastic thank you Lori I tasted it it's delicious but it's not the business for me this deal I am out but I'm not worried about you you're fantastic what is your path for improving your margins because to Mr Wonderful's point it's the more you grow the more you're digging a hole and with a 33% margin you're not going to be able to run a viable business have you thought about what you're going to do we are attacking it at different F funds one is the Machinery that we bought that's going to help us optimize our production proc esses second we were able to negotiate a better packaging deal that cut the cost of our packaging by half one last question what level of commitment do you have Daniel this is our baby it's my first baby I have the second B baby on the belly Cur congratulations thank you we we started this as we said from our own kitchen I was the first to quit my full-time job I had a great job and then my sister did the same thing we are extremely passionate about not only the product but our mission to promote our culture and to be ambassadors of the food that we grew up eating Daniel you know Mr liri has an offer and they're my offer is getting toast it maybe in your hand I you guys I your energy I your commitment I don't the margins I don't the Frozen space is tricky based on your $200,000 in sales the best I can do is to match his offer I will give you the $100,000 for 20% you need to decide if you want to swim with a shark or be eaten by one would you do 150,000 for 15% I wouldn't do that deal sorry I I also give you that offer Daniel no but you heard my feelings no no no I gave you exact same offer I would love to work with you Daniel I think there's many things that we could do together what was your counter again 150 for 15% that's $1 million R I'm Val I'm valuing the business at 500,000 one times revenue for a baked goods non proprietary terrible margin business the only reason I it is you guys and and it doesn't spite my glucose I'll give you instead of $100,000 I'll give you $150,000 for [Music] 20% guys this is my final offer it's generous offer you have a deal Dan good job Daniel

Genius litter today we're seeking $250,000 in exchange for 4% of our company sharks you ever wish your cat could understand what you are saying that is impossible but with genius litter you can understand what your cat is saying we love our cats they mean everything to us and that is why it is heartbreaking when our cats get sick and the worst part is we humans are clueless we don't even know when they're in pain and that is why me and O purri were set on a mission to find a better way to monitor your cat's Health introducing genius litter genius litter is a super smart Health indicating cat litter that changes color if your cat is sick it's having a health monitor in your cat litter box are you kidding me it's that simple it is genius but that's not all our litter is also super lightweight doesn't track in the house and traps all the yucky odors even Kevin's and for each bag we sell we donate 10 meals to pet shelters sharks who is ready to cut off up with me and Kevin oi and help every cat live a happier and longer life before I move on I'm going to take my work clothes off and I can answer any of your questions because this is not my real hair it's not real it's not real what what about the accent the accent is real I'm from the Netherlands tell us how it works our litter it's a silic litter and it's mixed with a pH tester test a urine if it's a high pH or low ph age it will tell you if there's a potential health issue for example if it turns red it could be a kidney problem if it's blue or green it could mean an UTI tell me how much does it cost you to make and how much do you sell it for we sell it at $24.99 per bag cost to make is $4.7 is that fully landed wow no landed cost it adds up anywhere between $130 and $156 do you have any competition cuz I feel I've seen an ad that does exactly this is that you guys or is that your compe our competitor what's different about yours ours is better because we use a different silica a smaller particle it's better for the paws it's also better Odor Control and less dust and we are more importantly we're cheaper now let's talk about the business how much are you doing year-to date in sales year to date is 3.1 million wow are you making or losing money we are profitable here today we're at 4 465,000 good for what did you do last year in sales last year in sale 3.6 million and we did one 145,000 how much is going to direct consumer how much through traditional pet retail our biggest channel is the online marketplaces 70% is Amazon and chewy com Walmark and then 20 24% is retail remaining is direct to Consumer it's a small amount direct to Consumer from your site yes correct now I ask you this because it was a famous deal here in Shark Tank called base Paws for cats it's not famous famous he's never heard of it have you heard of Base Paws yes the exit was huge but it all they wanted was the data that was it how much did you raise I raised a million dollars and I put a million dollars myself in it your own money where did you get the million dollars to put in I had an exit I sold company five years ago how much did you sell it for $9 million what a you will never never guess what it was dog food no I started an online blog about soap operas no no no that's crazy The American Dream Baby were you a huge fan no no at that time I was flipping content website I knew how to start a blog Drive traffic from SEO building communities on social media you've been successful what what the plan for this business yeah I want to build and scale this business and then sell it to strategic our competitor that you saw on TV was sold for a lot of money to how much is it lot what is out there in the news is $1 billion W same L how big did they get to they must have had the customer information there's 110 million cats in America yeah and that's a valuable database of users they buy a lot of stuff my gosh we're back to the datab get you the database Kevin but what's the plan tell us your plan we have two new products coming out one is a brand new nobody is selling it it's a health indicating topper you can sprinkle that on top of your existing cat litter and then it will change its color same our litter what's the second product it's a same concept as a health indicating doggy peep hat it changes color if potential issues with the pH Ramon I I want to tell you I think you're such an impressive man but this is not a space that I understand enough about and the idea of this competitor that's already had the big fat exit cast a little bit of a shadow over me I I hope you do with this but I'm out of this one it's not for me you're wonderful congratulations to what you've accomplished but it's not a business I want to be in for those Reasons I'm out listen Lori and I been talking about this this may be one of these cases where two sharks are better than one in terms of driving awareness of this product here's the deal we want 10% of the company for $250 but we want a $2 royalty until we get back a million bucks and then it goes away we'll do everything in our power to get more customers buying direct because that's where the exit value is Extreme royalty deals are yeah I don't think it's in the best interest for the compan exactly Ramon but if you believe in me then why not Equity Kevin only believes in money a lot more Equity maybe a lot more Equity look I think that director consumer is great I think it's always going to be a proportion of your business I got to tell you most people still buy their products in pet stores are you going to go away from retail no no not away you don't have to give up retail but when you get a direct relationship it's far more valuable all here's an alternative offer the first one's on the table but we've talked yes we've meowed a bit together and we'll do all equity for 20% 10 each and we go to work for you 20% yeah we that's ridiculous what does the cat think the cat is not happy o is not happy to give up that much Equity at this stage why would you even start the business yeah jly since he's profitable exactly I'll give you the 250,000 for 10% I can help you go faster in retail we can help you online I think think it's the offer for you you got to pay more for two sharks what about three sharks watch your counter for three sharks for three sharks I can do I can do 10% whoops I'll do that deal on my own that's what he offered I know yeah that's what I offer but now we have Lor and Kevin we have a higher chance of succeeding rone mate don't lose your deal why not 15 I would do it at 15 I think it's fair and I think it will help you go faster and farther than you ever dreamed do we have a deal this is hard one second you what about 133% 13 and two advisory shares and we'll figure it out we'll figure that out if we're going to be successful it won't matter Ron you're killing me because I came in here with four now we are at 15 that's why they call it the shark to I know it's you had a deal for 10 you didn't want that why are we talking about 2% 250,000 15% sh you came in asking for 4% I'm tired of this I'll do 250 for8 but you got say yes or no now w wow I want in on that I'm not

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] Next up is a product designed to help you get a grip on athletic performance. [Music] Hello Sharks. My name is Greg and I'm James. We are seeking a strategic partner and also $400,000 for 4% equity in our company. Hello James. What do all athletes need to perform at their peak? Three things, Greg. They need focus, training, and grip. , did you throw that? You guys have insurance for that, ? , . Grip. Grip is something we all take for granted. It's breathing. But what if we told you there was a revolutionary material that could alter performance outcomes in virtually any sport? Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement technology used to absorb oil on the skin and it's used for athletes, the military, and everyday uses that once applied absorbs oil in the skin that creates the slip in grip. Our grip solution is made from a unique but - tested material that's non-toxic, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, works even after being underwater, and is the first significant innovation in grip technology in nearly 70 years. We want a shark to come up and try it with us. Rashan. , how about you come up and try chocolates? Go get them, Rashan. Here, let's give you a try on the torque test. We'll see how you do. , here, step over here, please. . All . What I'm going to ask you to do when I say start is you're going to grab that metal bar and you're going to rotate it backwards as hard as you can. ? , our patent pending piece of equipment measures the amount of torque you're able to generate before your grip starts to slip. Got it? , let me push the start button. All . . Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. , excellent. All . , that there you maxed out about 14 pounds. You ever seen anything that? Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. , what we're going to do is we're going to put a single dose of chocolates on your hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. , we spring salt. You can barely see it. You can barely see it. You sprink it on. Now, put the other hand on top. . And grind them together. What you're doing, you're you're stripping away all the oil in your skin that makes it slippery between the cracks up. Yep. Once you're done, you clap away any residual material. And we're gonna do it again. , it's light. , you can barely feel anything. Let's see what happens. my god. Yeah, you tipped over the machine. Nice job. All , we'll see here. , that there, even with the machine tipping, which was your peak, you lost some of it there, you were still a 60% improvement in the overall torque you're able to generate once you got rid of that slippery component to your grip. Honestly, it didn't move at all. , it's it almost feels chalk, but more permanent almost. It's nothing chalk to be technically correct. That's why they call it chalk compared to chalk. What's the main difference? the main difference here is we're a subtractive material. we're trying to remove something. It's the oil on your skin that causes the problem. Let's talk sales. sales sales for this year thus far have been 740,000. Wow. here's the thing. Grip, no one thought about it, ? if no one's thinking about their grip, there's a huge marketplace for us in the grip. That's not true. Athletes deal with it. Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss deal with it. that's not nobody. No. What by nobody is the masses. , LeBron James, , LeBron James would benefit from our products much you cannot imagine. Then we don't want him to have it. Is this illegal in the NBA? No. Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, and fitness. And fitness is huge for us now. Yeah. And how much are you selling them for? , , this bottle here is $35.99. It's about 100 doses. And then the smaller one on display up here is $24.99. And how much does it cost you to make it? We prefer to have that discussion offline. Shark. How are we going to make a determination? We have and we have respectfully we have a supply chain. We make 67% margin on our product. you don't want us to work backwards, ? If you say you have 67% blended margins, then they know the fact that you gave us your blended margins but wouldn't tell us your cost annoyed the out of me. I'm out. Yeah. Thank Thank you. appreciate your honesty. How do you feel about it, Mark? Yeah. Yeah. , is there anything proprietary about it? , yes, there is. , we have two patents issued and two more pending for what? , for the material itself and the use of grip for the packaging and dispensing of the material and then also its use on different implements such as balls. Are you engineers? Are you What did you used to do? I'm a corrosion engineer by training. I'm involved with every major architectural firm in the country that gets involved with paint or coatings for high-rise structures, for nuclear power plants, for nuclear submarines. And what about you? , my full-time job is entirely chockless. My background was chemical engineering. How did you get your customers to come to you in the first place? That's our biggest problem. . If someone asks us what's your biggest challenge because that's why you're here, ? That's why we're here. much . is primarily for a strategic partnership to make our product know people know that we exist. Once they touch this product, they're sold. Hey guys, I I agree with you. I was getting ready to say that I'm a financial investor. I look to add accelerant to stuff that's growing fast. I do think it's a good fit for someone, but unfortunately not for me. I'm out. . No, thank you. Thank you, James and Greg. I can't even think of one thing I could do for you. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I have to get excited about what I invest in. And it's not in my wheelhouse, this this thing. It's a great product for you guys. It's not for me. , I'm sorry. I'm out. Thank you. Thank you. The only way I can do this deals with a royalty because the valuation is nuts. It's $10 million. It's crazy. , I give you the $400,000. I want $2.50 a unit. And I I'll take that until I make back $4 million in revenue. Then it drops down to nothing. 25 cents in perpetuity and I get the 4%. And then I turn on my entire social media team to try and get your CAC down, your oz up, cuz I'm completely incentivized to sell as much as I can as fast as I can. It's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. No, it's not a bad offer. That's why they call me Mr. Wonderful. It's the only offer it sounds you're going to get here. All . I don't think we should do it. They're not going to do it. There's no way that they're going to do it. Kevin, that's such a good deal. If you want me to come in with you to take your bases down, I'm telling you I would take a 100red or 200 of that if you want it. You want to do 200 of it? Sure. Same terms. I'm not changing my terms.

Going to split. Lucky day. , two 200,000 each term stay the same. And I can get this in the hands of 20 to 30 athletes as I'm sure most of us here can easily. Rashan can get a lot of these guys, which I . That's why I wanted as my partner. , you think they'll talk about it. Will they be willing to state that they're using the product? I think if we opened another round in the future and we gave them the opportunity to have to invest and be equity investors as opposed to brand ambassadors. Yes, you can't afford to have them as as marketing guys because they're too expensive. But they love talking about what they are. it's two sharks. I go crazy on social.

New Jersey and we're here seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% of our company Dan and I have been athletes our whole lives but as these bones get older our muscles don't recover as quickly that's for sure that's why I go see this guy for help as a physical therapist I use specific tools and techniques muscle scraping to help enhance blood circulation reduce pain and speed up the recovery process yep Dan's worked Wonders on my body but I can't bring him home with me that's why we teamed up to create sore soap the world's first do-it-yourself device made from allnatural analgesic essential oil powered soap it's designed to replicate the same Physical Therapy tool you could get at a doctor's office soap's been around for centuries as a matter of fact muscle scraping has been too we're the first to combine them switch your old boring bar to sore soap 90 seconds in the shower of scraping your muscles will reap the benefits of improved soft tissue Health Plus sore soap smells amazing lathers wonderfully and leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged sharks I scrape my muscles every day as I wash up and believe me I haven't felt this good since the '90s tell me which one of you is sore enough to join us in the shower no Dan in the company let's show the world the power of a shower with sore soap in front of you sharks is your own sore soap and our other line of products and Dan and I will talk you through how to use them now if anybody could maybe roll up their sleeve look Robert's already got his watch off he's ready to go I we knew you would if you want to take a towel and

Strokes on a 15 to 20\u00b0 Angle now it lathers up guys it will lather up and the point is to go downward you're massaging feels pretty good there's Menthol lavender and chamomile in it they're all anti does smell great yeah the beauty of our product we've Incorporated it into an activity of daily living that everybody does everybody woke up this morning and they shower why not do it in a therapeutic way that promotes soft tissue Health why therapy work the scientific answer is an increased what's called fi blast proliferation which leads to collagen synthesis all that means is it's encouraging tissue remodeling tissue regeneration what is this that's a polycarbonate tool called sore tool pro and what's great about is you could put it in your pocket go for a run you get a cramp you get sore you could use that what is your background guys I grew up playing sports my whole life I found myself in the trainer's room I grew in affinity for the Health Science field got my undergrad in biology then I went and got my doctorate in physical therapy I opened up my own practice David was a patient of mine first then he became a friend and now he's a business partner what's

got any wholesale orders yet yep we sell in some physical therapy offices and some Boutique gyms manatt between 15 and 17 that's margin for retail let me make a point about the product category for a second there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think it's going to be challenging to explain this I will use it but as an investor I'm out all even though I think it would do great on some of your and then there's one honestly my neck has been killing me I you watch me

seeking $400,000 for 10% of our company sharks let's be honest showering with a partner sounds fun but in reality [Music] it sucks one person's hogging all the hot water and the other's left shivering in the corner sure two showerheads would solve the problem but am I going to spend thousands of dollars on a renovation now you don't have to introducing bua tandem shower tandem is the only easy and costeffective way to add a second shower head to your bathroom it optimizes the water pressure using our Custom Engineered showerheads tandem installs in minutes it's simple all you have to do is extend the rod add the valve and connect the shower heads that's it no fancy contractors no knocking down walls it's an instant Spa upgrade sharks we're done showering on our own tandem is way more fun with a partner and we're looking for a long-term romance with one of you all Hannah David Shower times over sharks we've got some samples of Tandem in front of you and we'd welcome your questions how about the pressure do you divide the pressure in two the pressure first thing that we thought about and the main thing is we have 5,000 customers and our average rating is 4.7 out of five but what about the pressure yeah we could speak to the pressure I think the point more for us is the pressure was always a top of mine concern for any customer and it was great for us to see that the rating hit 4.7 th000 people bu over over 5,000 customers far over what period of time we did pre-order first and that started in April 2022 I'm surprised you have that many is this that big a problem yeah it's not a problem but it's an opportunity one thing I think one thing that's interesting is we went live in July and we started posting some some content on social media and we ended up blowing up we hit 50 million views on Tik Tok and 50 million views on Instagram and have over 50,000 followers on both platforms and a mailing list of over 40,000 people wow you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business the sales off the kickstarter were 750,000 wow how many units is that about 3,000 something what do you think you'll do this calendar year and will you make any money we think we're going to do 1.7 because we have done it's all organic this year once we went live we blew up how much you going to make on 17 our gross profit margin is 71% but but what's your net profit profit is 54% net profit is 54 you're going to make good for you you you think you're going to make over $850,000 yeah why does this item cost we have the first skew is $2.49 and that's with one of our showerheads then the second SK why would you even sell that a lot of customers are married to their handheld shower or maybe they purchase a showerhead that they and they're not ready to commit to our aesthetic and performance what is the other skew cost the two together is $2.99 the single head can you walk me through the cost landed cost of that one and then the dual head what's the landed cost of that one $69 landed for the first one it's we averaged it they're co9 landed for both SKS is what you're saying that's you're making money on every single sale now that's yeah what's your ultimate goal out of this we want to build a brand I think we have a lot of Ip around this product but we're not banking the business on it the next obvious opportunity for us is that the handhelds we have tons of customers that aren't converting it's a deriv of this you're going to stay in the shower St for sure for the beginning we are tandem focused when you think you'll hit 5 million in sales next year next year I don't buy it as a company yet I see it as a interesting Innovation as a product and some of the greatest deals in Shark Tank history is when the entrepreneur focused on that one application and maxed it out Max that's our Focus now I'm not sure you were telling me about building a business other SKS a brand strategy which scares me that's the biggest mistake startups make they you want to be a brand as opposed to executing on selling their product what builds because what builds a brand is your execution toally what too many companies do I'm doing brand marketing this is for the brand I'm going out there and I'm I'm presenting this I'm going to this trade show because I want to build my brand that's why for us the absolute focus is definitely on tandem and if we do create new products it's to support I say I can't relate to the product at all for two reasons one I'm a bther and I love high pressure and I'm concerned about you cutting the pressure in half secondly I couldn't imagine getting into a shower with my husband Bill getting naked it would be my idea of the worst nightmare on his side and online forget it you have a a younger demographic amount Brad I Jeff you guys have built a great business I bought a super fancy house with 10 shower heads and consistently I use one I'm not the person who would buy this I think it's hard for me to get there I'm out I wish you all the best guys I think it's a great product I think this is going to be a cash generating machine and the biggest mistake you can make would be to try to grow too fast take the money people are throwing at you but that's not conducive to an investor because if it's 400,000 for 10% you have to generate $4 million in after tax profits for me to get my money back I don't see it as an investable business I see it as an amazing business for you guys but for those Reasons I'm out I think you guys are amazing but I'm not connecting with the product as something for me to invest in I'm sorry I'm out I it I'm going to make you two offers you can choose between the two of them number one I'll do the $400,000 with a royalty per unit of $40 I would stop the royalty after I get 1.2 million back and I'll take the 10% Equity in case we sell it or I give you the $400,000 and I'm the third partner 33 and 13% and every dollar that comes out I'm getting 33 A3 Cent you're going to rush to do those deals you can decide because that's what I that's what I think is worth or or you can go have a shower how about 20% for $600,000 no 20% the comp $600,000 the funny thing is you you don't need 400,000 why would you do that to make it more he he gets more equity in the company no I know why you would do it to try to entice him why would you need to do that that's the only red flag that I've seen why would you give up 20% of your company even for $600,000 if you do 5 million next year you're making million Millions yeah millions of dollars and you're giving up a fifth of that you're guys you have an offer on the table what do you want to do what do you want to are you willing to negotiate on your offer I haven't heard anything I've heard squawking all I hear is squawking the only offer you have is me you we allow to come back in remember that go back in I'm still curious why would you give up 20% of your company for $600,000 when you're anticipating doing how much in sales this year we definitely think that it's going to be a discount on on what we're worth and what we've built here and demonstrated but for us this is a it's a it's a costly business how much cash do you have in the bank 250,000 for us it's having a resource that can help plus even strategize between different cash is an issue you may be profitable but because you're growing which got back to my point which is why I asked the question on profitability versus let's go go go go yeah we that's exactly what we want to do I'm out thank you you got to make a decision you can't do it that tells me you're not sharp you weren't going to do that deal that's I don't know but we don't have to worry about it see you later anyone else want to come back in no but guys Chase cash not sales you came to the Vice tank good luck guys thank you all much bye for us it went about as as we could have hoped we would have loved to have gotten a deal but I think their logic makes sense and I'm excited to continue building this business exactly as per their advice they had no ability to focus on the only offer they had you got to realize you have a real offer you got to focus on it I got

show 3 years ago after a few hits watching these hundreds of millions of dollars for our employer and we were getting paid salaries I decided to leave I called up Adam first we started prototyping these gadgets and the best concept we had when we were working was on this chess product we took it the kickstarter and from there we had enough revenue from Kickstarter to start the company did kick we did $1.7 million in 39 days wow what were you looking to raise We've set the goal at 30,000 that is crazy you raised 1.7 million but you're asking for 300,000 for 5% 6 million valuation what are

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi, I'm Adam Cookson. Hi, I'm Craig Bicki. We're from Denver, Colorado. Our company is Techry. We're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, this toilet stands before you today guilty of a terrible crime. Murder. That's . This porcelain perpetrator is the number one reason people lose phones to water damage. It doesn't stop there. Toilets, swimming pools, washing machines. Each year in the US, these kill 22 million phones with water damage. We've invented a machine that can bring phones, tablets, laptops, watches, anything that fits in the chamber back to life. It's not magic. It's science. Have a look inside our machine in real time. Transforming liquid into gas. Restoring your phone in 30 minutes. No need to disassemble or take anything apart. Sharks, this is my personal phone. It has no special protection, but I'm not worried. And I'm not worried. You murderer. , let's make a deal. Sharks. This is one opportunity you don't want to flush away. gosh. I'm going to take a moment to rescue this phone and then show you our process. This is a gut-wrenching moment for customers. Bring it in for service as quick as you can. Your device starts rusting as soon as it gets wet. , inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. , I feel it's a heart attack. You got to get CPR fast, ? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. ? , technically someone could ship it to you. , are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as as we have a mail-in service. But what are your sales? last year with a few stores we did $29,000 82 stores, ? We're talking about last year. Sorry, did you say that last year you sold the incredible amount of how much? $29,000 in sales with a few stores. We focused on making the economics on a per store basis profitable. . And then we launched to 82 stores and only two months later we've been asked to launch to 600 stores. What were your sales after the balance of the stores? this year we're on track with the expansion to hit $650,000. you go to a store and you say, \"Put this in for free or do they pay you?\" , you don't pay unless it works. They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? , in the in the beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? , on average, it works out to about $80 rent a month. Wait, $80 rent per month you're charging them. And then on top of that, we get a rev share, a percentage of the revenue. What's the percentage? On average, it's about 16%. , in order to do all this, you had to have raised a bunch of capital. We've raised 2.2 million far. Wow. Wow. And what was the value of the company post money? It had a valuation cap of 4.8 million. why is your valuation high? This is about getting to $800 per month per store. That's $6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in profit. But you're not doing that today. No. But if you discount that back from when we will be doing it, that's still far above $10 million. And what do you place as a value on that risk in case you don't execute? , honestly, I see you totally as an online business. You said you have three days, , in which it can still survive. We have an online market, but we haven't been able to afford national marketing for the online. I don't understand why you think you want to go retail. I don't see the big market. I'm out. Thank you. You came in asking for a $10 million valuation and I don't know how you're going to make that back that fast. And , unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. I think technology is your enemy. I was reading something the other day that the new Apple phone is almost totally water resistant. , I think the technology improvements can put you out of business by the time you figure out your model. Wouldn't put my money there amount. Guys, look, I the idea. I the concept, but you you're going to have to keep on raising capital. And unless I gave you that capital, I'm going to keep on getting diluted. The problem is how do I get my money back? , one of the reasons I think we're going to succeed is not because we may have a good plan. It's because we have an awesome team. Have you ever heard anybody start a company, hire their people, and say, \"We have a horrible team.\" That's not enough. I'm out. , everybody's out. Mr. Wonderful's left. I the story. I understand the model. I I don't want to argue about your valuation. I think it's too high. I'm going to loan you this 500k at 13%, but I'm taking the 5% as an equity warrant. That's the value I bring as a shark to this. , I want it paid back in 36 months. What do you think of this offer? Would you be willing to go more than 500,000 now? You asked for 500. That's the deal I would do. And I'm the only shark here today willing to give you an offer. , what do you want to do? All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We'll take that deal. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. That's terrific. Thank you much. Sounds Kevin. Let's see how your new investment works. Do it, Mark. That's great. , God. All , guys. Thanks. Do it. You got to have confidence. Do it. Kevin, if you believe in and the product, why not put it in the water? I'm not doing that.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Adam Cookson, Craig Bicki, Wonderful, Kevin, Mark (PERSON), Denver, Colorado, US (GPE), Techry, Apple (ORG), 5%, about 16%, 13%, the 5% (PERCENT), 30 minutes (TIME)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the chamber, our company, water damage, the machine, the time, a store, your sales, a few stores\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 500,000\n  \u2022 kill: phones\n  \u2022 invent: machine\n  \u2022 have: look\n  \u2022 transform: liquid\n  \u2022 restore: phone\n  \u2022 have: protection\n  \u2022 bring: it\n  \u2022 have: beads\n  \u2022 turn: liquid\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.11)\n\n**Topics:** store, phone, machine, shark, year",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nnext up is a more stylish way to enjoy your [Music] lunch hi sharks my name is Ali kinety I'm the founder of modern picnic and I'm here seeking $400,000 in exchange for 6.5% of my company as a young professional working in New York City I would go into the office every day trying to look feel and do my best but when it came to packing lunch my options were unprofessional and definitely not stylish sure I could use a brown paper bag but my mom doesn't pack my lunch anymore and a plastic bag definitely not sustainable or functional or I could carry something this but I wouldn't be caught dead carrying this into the office sharks the outdated lunchbox needed a makeover I gave it one meet modern picnic fashionable insulated vegan leather lunch boxes you can bring your food wherever you go and no one would ever know what to lunchbox and we launched with our first product the luncher which as you can see here Chic functional and clean with the easily wipable interior to protect against those everyday spills but that's not all since we've launched we've since come out with the range of different shapes and sizes for all of your meal prep needs whether that be our toad or backpack because sometimes bigger is better our snacker perfect for the little things or our newly launched food containers designed to fit perfectly inside sharks who's ready to ditch those childish lunchboxes in those wasteful paper and plastic bags with modern picnic I hope you guys are hungry because I packed your lunch today in front of you you're some of our bestselling products let's open it up and see what's inside clever alley super cool what are you going to do to the per snatching industry cuz when they steal this expecting to find jewels in it you're going to find a ham and Ry in here it's a great idea I think it's worth 30 I was 22 years old when I came up with the idea for modern picnic and was able to successfully launch a company within 2 years with absolutely no prior experience connections funding highlighting my ability to make things happen not only myself but most importantly the company figure things out good for you how old are you now I'm 29 amazing and what do they cost what do you sell them for they range our aovs $155 we call ourselves attainable luxury you guys will love this our product margins are EX excellent averaging in the ' 80s landed duties paid it drops down to the 70s and gross margin it's a healthy 60 give us a dollar amount for this yeah the little one what do you sell it for what is that is around 30 35 what what you sell it for 159 wow allly the issue is you can't sell this in retail because people are going to compare it to purses not understanding the vision of The Lunchbox it's all online now while our e-commerce direct a consumer business accounts to the majority of our Revenue what's the majority 70% we started going wholesale this year and it's already accounted for 20% of our sales we are now sold in Sachs we launched in The Container Store and this morning good I got my vendor number for Bloomingdales which I think is a sign you're asking for a 6.15 million yes valuation you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business we've done under $6 million in cumul of sales from over 40,000 units sold what year did you start we launched in 2018 and what will you do this year we're projected to do over 2 million in sales this year and how much will you make this year we're projected to lose under $100,000 in sales why are you not profitable where are you spending the money the money's got to be going somewhere because if you're you said you're going to do how much this year over 2 million and you've got 60% margins that's 1.2 million in gross margin cont contribution where's that 1.2 million go yeah and in terms of how we're acquiring customers in recent years we've created an emphasis on having a healthy Diversified marketing mix we do affiliate marketing Tik Tok email SMS we have a optimized website but there's definitely I love how excited you are I want to go back to Mark's question yeah 1.2 million in gross margin where did that money go how much did you spend on Advertising about 25% of our revenue is going towards marketing that's where it is Ally I'm still trying to wrap my head around how you're spending money now if 25% of your costs are going is that digital marketing and you're spending additional money in brand marketing that's correct what is the total cost of marketing when you look at that 1.2 what is the total cost of markings it's not 25 it's much more than that yeah it and that's why we're how much I would say it's probably 50% on total marketing that's it's too much on marketing yeah way too much because that's that's where all your money is going it's you are way overpaying to find customers now and that's why you're not putting enough money on the bottom line because your margins are pretty good for this type of product your margins are amazing you're you're overpaying to acquire customers now do you have investors as I mentioned food strapped the company for a couple of years shipping out of my parents garage they're you got to get out and in 2020 I knew I had to raise some capital I had absolutely no idea what it meant to raise capital I went out and cold Outreach to 1,300 investors my ended up raising $900,000 what yeah we currently have a seed round proper seed round open which we've raised an additional 900,000 for you've raised the first 900 plus another 900 Ellie let me take a crack at this I applaud you on what you've achieved here and your presentation was almost flawless until we got into the numbers you're spending much money trying to build a brand and I have zero interest in funding a brand in fashion that is hard to do and pretty soon you're going to figure out that's not a good Pursuit I'm out thank you much yeah allly I would say you need to have more confidence in yourself and your product and I know that sounds counterintuitive but when you're spending much on Advertising that's typically because the entrepreneur is afraid that sales might fall we're afraid there won't be the demand there if you stop you're having to go out and raise money you have to be disciplined to spend less yeah it's not for me I'm out allly you're a Dynamo great presentation Kevin said I don't think the numbers work now I'm sorry I'm out thank you what I don't love is when a young company does many raises fast for much money I'm a big believer in you make money you roll it back in and I'm sorry I'm out yeah thank you shipping out of my parents garage we had to raise some money because we had to move out and we had to make some changes we were putting zero dollars into marketing the first three years in the garage and that's why we raised that that's you said it yourself go back to those times yeah I think one of the biggest lessons that I learned when I started good American and let me tell you I had two different sets of investors I had the old guys and the young guys the young guys said to me spend spend spend chase that Topline growth and the old guys said to me you're going to need profit when the tid's turn you have to think about running and that is lucky I was I'm going to listen to these old guys cuz they look richer and they've done more business and I think about this all the time it is a curse of many young Founders that I know that they have plowed much money into the belief that digital marketing coupled brand marketing and spending these huge percentages is leading to all of these sales but never ever looking at the fundamentals of the business what I will say to you and what I've seen in my own experience if you look at whatever you're spending on meta on Facebook on Tik Tok in any other platforms you start winding it down I'm telling you I I almost guarantee it you will not see a difference in your sales I think you're amazing I love the products I'll be a customer but for those Reasons I'm out good luck Ally we wish you all the best thank you thank you for sharing this with us today\n\nNLP

My company is DNA Simple and I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange for 12 and a half% of the company. Sharks. Experts are saying that we are due for a new pandemic, a catastrophic disease that can devastate humanity. And that's why medical research is even more important than ever. And that's where we come in. DNS Simple is looking to make genetic research happen 10 times faster that cures to diseases can be found 10 times faster. And my company is paying you for your saliva samples. It's all anonymous and it happens in four easy steps. Number one, you tell me about yourself in 2 minutes on our DNA simple website. Number two, we match you to a research study that's looking for people you. Number three, we ship you this little tube to your house with a prepaid step. And number four, we give you $50 after you've returned the sample back to us. And you can do this as many times as you can. You heard correctly. We're paying you for spinning in the tube. Normally, it's an extremely expensive and long process for researchers to get enough samples for studies. And our company is making it simple. We pay you for a spit, researchers get the samples they need, and we get paid for making it all happen. It's a win-win for everybody. Now, sharks, who's ready to join me in saving mankind? I will come around and show you what the kits look . Great. Is this one for you? Thanks, Olivia. Let me give Lori hers. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Thank you, sir. You're welcome, Lori. Hopefully, you do match a study and get your $50. Thank you much. Great. You said that you spit into the tube, send it back to you, you will pay that person $50, and they can do it as often as they want. They get matched for a study. Correct. For example, if there are 10 researchers across the US that are looking for someone aged 20 to 45 that fit in a particular profile. No, get it . 20 to 25. 20. In your case, 20 to 25. Yes. And every time you do match, you get a notification that you can participate to the study and then we send you a kit and every time you can get that $50. Olivia, I only get $50 if you can match me to a study. I will send this to you after you've matched the study. . how much are they paying you? Typically, it would go around 155 per. , the research companies are paying you $155 and you're paying $50 of that off the top. Yes. For the sample, correct? Any other cost to you? , the kit, we have we're making the kits inhouse. And what's it cost you to make each one? $125. , people are answering online and they're telling you about themselves and you're trusting that that information is accurate, ? How do you vet that it is? for example, if I'm giving this to a cancer researcher, I could be a drug addict, which is going to completely skew the test. , I leave that to the researcher to decide what is that one burden of proof that the person has to submit to be qualified. They only upload a little bit and then you reach out to them according to the study and say, \"Do you have more proof?\" Exactly. You put the information that the researchers will use. , let let me ask some more about yourself. , where where in Queens are you from? , I lived in Flushing for a little bit. I'm from Haiti. I I grew up in Haiti, but in Haiti, we got the earthquake. after high school, I moved to New York because I had a lot of families there. And that's where opportunities took me and worked my butt off. I worked up to five jobs in college and majoring in chemistry and biochemistry and graduated with honors in biomedical science research at Queens College. I tutored French, Spanish, math, chemistry, and biology to private students. I was selling bags and and watches at Fossil and I was working also next door selling jeans and shirts at American Eagle. Wow. , I got a full scholarship to go to Penn State for both an MD and a PhD. Can I make a non-political comment here? You you're the exact reason why America should open up to immigrants. , cuz what a wonderful example you are and to come from Haiti and do such great work. But why do you think it's going to be a pandemic? What we've realized in the past decade or is that there are subtypes of the same disease that's directly based off your genes and your DNA. the only way to figure this thing out is to study people's DNA. Do you have a database? you go through hospitals and research centers who know who needs this DNA. Yes. the researchers are there. Are you going out to them or are they coming to you? both. . Both. But give me an example. How much money do they typically give you? Do they need 10 samples? A typical study at an academic institution would need 30,000 samples up to 100,000 samples, but the range is extremely wide. You could use a small study where you need 25 samples. Have you sold any far? Yes, we have. We've matched over 500. We've sold for $30,000. And how are you sourcing your subjects? The most effective far has been social media. How'd you get the trust for your company? It it was a little tougher at the beginning. Now that we've have significant press this year, I made the Forbes list 30 under 30 in science. , that's Yeah, that's . , thank you. And , we've been everywhere. , now it's more we need the machine to get more of a presence social media. I used to sell my blood all the time. That was the only way I could afford. Yeah. , but this is a new age version of that. Yes. It's amazing. Where's the competitive advantage, Olivier? Why is your company worth a million dollars today? , I've worked in the field, I understand exactly what researchers want and what can pass and what will not pass. I did this research for my PhD. I think that's a competitive advantage there. But obviously if we get one of you sharks on board, that's a significant advantage. What do you need the money for? Do you need entry into larger research facilities? Do you need until I have 100,000 people in my database? I can't go to Fiser and say, I want to help you lead that next big research you're going to do. Some researchers in a 5year grant, you spend three to four years to recruit people. Wow. , there are studies that die because let's say you're doing a study where you need a thousand blacks or Hispanics, and I'm in Hershey, Pennsylvania. No offense, it would take about 100 years to get those people, ? , less than 5% of clinical trials have minorities in them. Some people are hard to find. And this idea, that's their competitive advantage. , look, I've sat here listening for for a change and not contributed. But having listened, I think it's interesting. I'm incredibly impressed with you and your drive. I'll offer you $100,000 for 25%. [Music] I'll make you an offer, but I want you to say yes or no now. . I'll give you $200,000 for 20%. [Music] Mark, is it is it if I listen to a couple offers? I I appreciate that offer if you want to do business with me. And if not, I understand. You have two offers on the table. Would you be willing to decrease a little bit in the equity and go 15? Sure. Yep. Deal. Deal. Done. , master from Congratulations. I love the idea, man. We'll make that. We'll kill it. We'll change the world at least. I'll give I'll give you a hug as . done. I still think it I get on. Yeah. No, go.

anti does smell great yeah the beauty of our product we've Incorporated it into an activity of daily living that everybody does everybody woke up this morning and they shower why not do it in a therapeutic way that promotes soft tissue Health why therapy work the scientific answer is an increased what's called fi blast proliferation which leads to collagen synthesis all that means is it's encouraging tissue remodeling tissue regeneration what is this that's a polycarbonate tool called sore tool pro and what's great about is you could put it in your pocket go for a run you get a cramp you get sore you could use that what is your background guys I grew up playing sports my whole life I found myself in the trainer's room I grew in affinity for the Health Science field got my

second there's a deal here on Shark Tank called Blue land it's it's in the cleaning fluids and detergent business and I invest in that deal I learned something about this category retail is two tiers of distribution for cleaning fluids you're going to have to sell it in for about 11 bucks but it's it's going to be a expensive soap look guys I have I have a horse in the race in blue Land good luck to you thank you I'm out I wanted to jump back to something because I before you jump back I want to clear the deck a bit everybody is in the soap business and I also think this will never do in the large stores because you can't demonstrate it I think it's a difficult sell Beyond direct to Consumer for that reason alone amount we appreciate your time thank you David it's a great idea it's a great product but as an investor I tend to look for things that are going to be a little more expansive maybe more of a product category not a single skew definitely be a customer I'll buy it but I'm out for the deal understand I would to bring this one up other point up I think what you did is smart I do think it's a DTC I'm not sure about it being in the store I think it's going to be

I'm Ronnie Pritchette and I'm Nancy Pritchette and we're from San Diego, California and we're the married co-founders and co-owners of Triple Light. We're seeking $400,000 for 10% equity in our company. Wow. Our patented technology improves the flex. -. no. It's our luck. The lights would go out when we're getting ready to make our big pitch to the sharks. No. , it's a good thing you have a flashlight, Ron. That's . , that's not too bright, huh, Ron? That's not a flashlight. Now, this is a flashlight. Wow. You're . That is a flashlight. I'm always , Ron. that. Sharks. Since the invention of the flashlight in 1899, the only significant improvement has been the bulb inside. The light may be brighter, but the spill of light is still the same. Why would anyone want to use this ancient thing when they could use the 180\u00b0ree flashlight? Our triple light patented technology shines crisp white LED light and a wide 180\u00b0ree arc. This is thanks to three perfectly positioned LED bulbs that shine an ultra bright light 180\u00b0 wide and 160 ft in front of you. The triple light will light up an entire room, your backyard, or anywhere you need it most. Instantly, helping you feel safe and secure. Now, thanks to the Triple Light, you'll never have to wave your flashlight back and forth ever again. , Char, who wants to join the Triple Light family and help us brighten up our world? Good job, guys. I got to tell you, that was good theater. Guys, tell us about you and how you guys met and how you got into business and all that. , I went to the University of Georgia and a year after I graduated, I married Ronnie. Then, we had two children. I became a stay-at-home mom and when the kids grew up, left the house, Ron came up with this. How long have you two been married? 41 years. Yeah. , congratulations. How long ago did you invent Triple Light? , it was in 2012. I'm walking down the steps in our backyard and I have a traditional flashlight this. As I'm going down the steps, something left caught my eye. I did that to see what it was. , when I did, the steps became dark and almost tripped and I weighed it back. And I thought, why should I have to wave a flashlight back and forth? Why can't I turn on a flashlight and not see straight ahead but left and ? And thus the idea of the triple light 180\u00b0ree flashlight. And were you an inventor in , I'm a golf professional. Golf? , you are? Yeah. Are you serious? I've been a golf professional since 1976. , I knew I had to be the one to get it going because he was selling golf putters to make a living for us, but I had no business experience whatsoever. , I had to start from scratch and I learned everything I could about business, marketing, and sales. What have you sold? Our lifetime sales is at $5 million. Wow. Yeah. Good for you, Nancy. And that technically, he did come up with it in 2012, but it took him 2 years to get the patents and, , get it started, get the prototypes. We launched in 2014, but I want to say we didn't launch until 2020. We've done over $4 million in four years. What did you do last year? Last year we did $1,77,000. And what will you do this year? We're projected to do $1.5 million this year. Wait, there's some there's a disconnect here. you came up with it 2012. You got the patent in 2014, but you don't have sales to 2020. What happened? , we launched in the fall of 2014 and we sold over $100,000 worth of flashlights. In 2015, the sales jumped to five $310,000. And then in 2016, in the first quarter, everything changed. We brought on an investor. We brought brought him on for capital and what we thought mentorship. Then in 2018, January, they sued us for control of our company. Sorry. What? , we fought back and in a few months, August of 2018, they were removed from our company and Nancy and I got our company back 100%. Wow. Yay. Nancy, there's something special about being able to stand up to get your company back. what? I have to tell you, at the time, we trusted people and that was our mistake. I've had it happen to me, too. It happened. what? It's extremely sad. There's a lot of people out there that are wolves. Tell me what is your cost? What is your wholesale? What is your retail? , for the flashlights there in front of you, the TL800, that one landed to $6.50, wholesales for 15, retails for $29.95. . , you did a million last year. You think you'll do 1.5. What will your profits be on that? 318,000 before. Is that before or after paying yourself before? , we don't pay ourselves. . why haven't you gone or been approached by other flashlight companies to get this technology? I look at this and I say why is every flashlight in the world not this? We we were approached by a couple of the big boys. They wanted to pay us a small royalty. We have five utility patents and a design patent in 27 countries around the world. This is selfevident. Every flashlight should be this. That's correct. Look, I I get the whole story. I see the product innovation. I I understand because you're freaked out about control. You've lived through that horrible slime ball, whoever it was, that screwed you out of your company. I don't want control. ? I want you to make every decision after I show it to you. I would to make you an offer that says, \"Look, I'll give you the $400,000. I want 49%.\" , hell no. Excuse me. Do you want to hear the offer? No. And then you march with me into every single retailer in America. Haven't they suffered enough? Excuse me. In Shark Tank after 15 years, I deal with everybody. . I'm going to introduce you to distributors of the three major major retailers. And we may have to adjust pricing. And you say yes, no. Yes. You're giving them a valuation from less than one times their sales. you're doing a decent amount of money. You've done 5 million in sales. You have 27 countries with patents. You have five utility patents. Are you happy doing what you're doing? The answer to that is yes. But here's the thing. this has been my baby. And I want to I want to stress that a little bit. I didn't have any business experience whatsoever. But I learned and I grew and I I've brought this. I I've brought this to almost $5 million in sales in lifetime sales. , it's not we haven't I had to work hard to get it to this point. But, we are at a point, I'll tell you that I've gotten it, I think, as far as I can get it. And I think now I feel I'm ready. We need somebody. We need a shark to help us get to the next level because this can go global. This can be a hundred million dollar company a year. I'm telling you. Listen, I think there's some magic in you guys. I will give you an offer non-negotiable for 25%. ? I will give you the $400,000 and we will partner with you to help you grow cuz you should have a much bigger size. , great. Wow. It's a good offer. I Ron, Nancy, I think you guys have done a great job. Lots of challenges. I'm skeptical. Not about you. That's . I think the product is good in all this time. No one's picked it up. I think there's more to the story. What do you want to do? Do you want to close the deal? I'm out. Go for it. Trying to come in. Are you ready to She said I love you and and I love you, too. Put your hand here. Excuse me. One shark is out. Ron and Nancy have two offers on the table from Kevin and Daniel for their innovative flashlight company, Triple Light. But Mark and Lori may also be interested. Are you ready to put She said I love you and and I love you too. Put your hand here. Excuse me. Don't let those bandito people over here. You are one of our that are sharks. Hello. Hello. Hello. Would you to hear us? We'll do the same deal. 25% but you get two of us. Or one that's going to work extra hard and that's going to put 80. It's not we're going to be sitting on a couch eating bon bons. Same deal as Daniel, but you get two for one. You do not necessarily want to have two sharks in a deal there. A lot of things can go wrong. There's too much divide and conquer. We will carry the way with you. I give you my word. You will be in good hands. . We will try to get you into the major stores Home Depot. I have great relationships with all of them as does Mark. but also to try to license it because why not? You have all these patents. Why not also have a This is the way I see it, guys. 100% everything Lorie said, ? And us, we've worked together on a lot of companies, but when I look at Nancy and I see how emotional you get, this is being a parent where you did all you could to get them through high school and college. It's time for them to go in and you want to be the proud parents that say, \"I started that. I got them through school and now it's a $50 million company.\" That would be our goal, guys. It's your moment. What do you want to do? You got three options. . , my gosh. Would either of you take 20%. Anybody? 20. , honestly, we're worth 25 because we're going to let you We're going to let you relax a little, but stay in a little. We want I can tell I'll take that. I'll do it for 20% if you say yes. Now, look, if you want two sharks, I'm happy to go in with Daniel. I'll I'll do the 20% with Daniel for 400,000. my gosh. Daniel, thank you much for your offer. We love you and you were one of our top picks. But Lori and Mark, you have a deal. my god. Congratulations. Thank you much. My pleasure. We are going to make that man rude the day he ever tried to hurt you. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. Thank all of you. Good luck, guys.

don't notice them they're there they look great Mark you can't tell you're wearing them can you no no they feel secure what are these lights sell for these lights sell for $59.95 we we wholesale them for $30 what do they cost you to make we get them shipped and landed for $15.50 we've sold 6,000 of them what are your sales today to $260,000 we've only been in operation for8 months wow what do you think you're going to sell this year and next year and how much money you going to make this year with investment would be a 760,000 dollar year and that's 20,000 investment we have enough inventory on hand to do an organic year of about $300,000 you mean you don't have enough money to buy enough inventory to sell more how much do you guys have left we have about 15,000 you're backs up against the wall when I go out biking in the morning I could hardly find a spot on the on the road in Central Park that's how many bikers are out there I rarely see someone running at night and that's a city of 8 million people I mistrust the quantity of people who want to run at night I'm I'm out based on that I I I appreciate that but I would to also mention the night shift there more there is more it's called the night shift is for the occupational safety Market it is for people who work at night it is for construction workers do Road workers out there now no that's not bad though no this is a way anything with Sho anybody who works in the dark that Haso get hit by cars they do that's a little more interesting because I can see broader you put this on a work boot part of the problem is you named it Night Runner and there's your work boots that's why the new model we will be called night shift this is the real game changer we know we can get our feet wet with the athletic Market but the occupational safety Mar why do why can't the existing product do that resources if you're going to work an entire shift you need to last 8 to 10 hours the battery life that's the problem it's yeah the these are meant for over four hours I think you has done a great job I think we can help you with expanding the product line I'll give you the 250,000 for 30% I it too I was thinking I was going to go out but when you showed me the product for the industrial safety and walking Market that got my juices flowing that makes a lot more sense to me if it becomes a standard safety item the mining industry is going to be huge with this the security Market at night that appeals to me I would do this 250,000 for 15% you better grab that away yes I got a question for you you could take Kevin's offer or you could take Robert's offer or you could take what's behind door number two would you be door number three by I don't have to be number three it's door number two you want to ask yourself do I feel lucky do you have an offer Lori 300,000 for 20% I'm going to give you a little bit more money asking a little more Equity I'm not a runner I'm a walker but I love it because it's smart product and that's why I want to be involved with it cuz products what I do wow thank you much I tell you preparing for this opportunity we said gosh every single one of you offer something what a that we need we are our sales are increasing in the southern hemisphere remember you have three offers on the table why are you keeping everybody waiting as you're out of respect stop selling focus on the offers you you have three offers Robert's 250,000 for 30% Lor's 300,000 for 20% and I'm 250,000 for 15% you've got to make a decision hey Doug listen I'm going to change my offer I'll give you 200,000 for 15% because I think that's the cash to buy inventory get the product out on top of that I'll give you 150,000 as a pure loan my total offer is 350,000 in effect for 15% but 150 of it debt I'll throw in an offer to tell you where I'm at it's going to take a lot of work what I'll do is I'll offer you the 250k for 30% but I'll offer you unlimited purchase order financing Mark's going the other way he's back up to the 30% could we have a minute to talk about this absolutely we're not going to go far what do you think these are all good offers Robert obviously is the most in tune with with running it's a lot of work I'm not saying the other ones it for the running Market I it for everything else but Kevin believes in the occupational safety Market that's the highest valuation what about going in all together for the 30% count me I don't even get this product if we're going to do that why don't we go up to 35 or something yeah why don't you why don't we to the last $155,000 guys before before you start while you were away we also talked amongst ourselves one of the risks of leaving the room and that's always a risk in Shark Tank sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad let me explain you've now got two offers across four sharks broken up this way Mark's offer is he's the Lone Wolf now he's going to make you that offer 250,000 for 30% the other three sharks that offer a lot we're going to make the same you're going to get three sharks for the same amount we'll give you the 250,000 for 30% three sharks with all the benefits they have they decided to copy me for obvious reasons but the competition happens we all the deal we we I think we thought you're willing to give up more Equity I'll be honest with you we came in here looking as a 20% being a being a ceiling is there is there any offers that would cap the equity at 20 % not mine not ours you got a lot of work to do if you want the benefit of multiple sharks you got to leave them a little bit of meat on the bone you came back in saying you wanted to do it for 20% and I had offered you 300 for 20% I would do the 250 for 20% you're leaving the team now interesting that's a shk move there's no Unity on the team anymore obviously these alignments can fall out of fa a quickly but I would do this you got to take that now I'll go back to mine I'll do the 250,000 for 15% and Doug what I'll go back to my I will go back to my original offer my original offer 300 for 20 I'll do 350 for 15 I don't believe this it's would you a not Robert is 200,000 for 15% plus 150,000 of debt for your inventory Lori is 300,000 for 20% and I am 250,000 for 15% and Mark is 250,000 for 30% with unlimited financing all what do you guys want to do all first of all thank you much for all of the offers I I want to ask Kevin yeah do you have the same passion for the other markets that you do the occupational safety Market I have a passion to make money you show me the direction you want to put your focus on I'll support you it's you need somebody that knows this Market with you that uses a product I'll do the 250 for 15 and the 100 of it as a loan it doesn't matter you're getting 350,000 in cash don't make an investment with somebody who doesn't understand or use the product that's ridiculous that's a the only time Kevin runs is to lunch I'm a fine-tuned athlete I can kick his ass and squash every day robt let me ask you this yes sir would you go in with Lori at 20% for two sharks I'm in Lori no I'm sorry I think if it were the two of us together we were doing before then you have to be at the 30% then Robert I accept your offer of 250,000 wow I wanted I go in with Lori I go with Kev you thank you much congatulations guys congrat that was great thanks for the shoes you're wel [Music]\n\nNLP

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nHi Sharks. I'm Mona Weiss and I'm Scott Shields and our company is Econuts. We are seeking 175,000 for a 15% stake in our company. Econuts is a line of eco-friendly cleaning products packaged with little to no plastic. Now, I know what you're thinking. , it's another green cleaning company. But Econuts are totally different. Most of our products are certified organic and are based on this. This is our secret weapon. It's an organic berry from the Himalayas that naturally produces a soap. It's called a soap berry or soap nut, thus our name, Ecouts. You can use these berries for laundry by placing four to five of them. Place them in the wash bag directly in your machine. When it comes in contact with the water, it releases a natural soap as it gets shaken around, which can do your laundry. This jar of water is going to represent your washing machine. I'm going to place in one [Music] It makes soap. Isn't that cool? , you can It It's still solid. , it does. You can reuse these up to 10 times. , this box here does a year's worth of laundry and it replaces 10 bottles of detergent. And now is the perfect time to invest. Americans spend over $70 billion a year on cleaning products. And with your help, we can help take a bite out of it and help save the planet. What do you say, Sharks? You with us? , why is it the perfect time to invest? , we were first to the mainstream market and now we are going to be everywhere. We've managed to capture about 90% of the soapberry market thus far by branding. market there is a soapberry market out there. What percentage? of 90% in less than three years. How big is the soap berry market? How big is it annually? It's in the US it's around about a million dollars. you have $900,000 in sales. No, I walked into that one, didn't I? Let's do the math. Yeah. Yeah. I caught you with your mouth open. I got it. Let's Why don't you put one of those soap berries in your mouth now? Can we Can we go back to Scott's point of 90% market share? How much does that equate to in terms of sales? 90% market share for us. What it equates to is last year we did about $100,000. This year we're already on track to do over 250,000. Can I see a sample? Why yes, absolutely for your idea. I love Mona. Mona is the champ. Are these the nuts? Yes. Thank you, Mona. Are the two of you married? Not yet. We're working. We're engaged. You are. Congratulations. , don't congratulate me. We've been engaged for 5 years. Mona, Mona, let me ask you. Why does a guy stay engaged for 5 years? Why would he do that? We're not using the investment money to get married, but we need to bring our business to the next level that we can get married. Let's say this market takes off. You're assuming your brand, Econuts, will maintain its dominance. , first of all, we have a proprietary sterilization process. And we came up with this because while he and I were in our living room originally sorting berries and we had people who were helping us out sorting berries, we were all getting sick and we we decided that there must be something going on with these. we sent them off to a lab and we found they had stuff on stuff on nuts. Imagine that. you had to get your nuts sterilized. They had monkeys. Everybody needs their nuts sterilized. And if you look into if you look into trying different sterilization practices you'll find it's difficult to get one that is for organic. I'm going to ask you an important question. You have 90% of the market. You say you you've done about 250. You're asking for a little over a million valuation. Uhhuh. Give me the valuation why you came up with is based on the fact that every year we've been in business, we've doubled and tripled our sales. We started our company with $1,000. Now we didn't put any more money into it for over a year. We made $10,000. Our next year we made $40,000 and we saw the business was going somewhere we put it. We're still not making any money. We've we've done over a h 100,000 this year already. How did you secure your customer base? , I'm a social media ninja. , we've got more fans on Facebook than you do, Barbara. , I'm insulted and I'm out. There you go. , no. Don't be out yet. I'm only kidding. No, no, no. Look at that. The market is small now and what you've got a million dollars of sales in the US means a tremendous amount of education has to occur before people that do laundry are going to start buying nuts. It's going to be a tough haul. I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm not saying you're not the best. It's that your company today is not worth over a million dollars. It isn't. You're not making enough money yet. You're not even married yet. For 175,000 I probably have to own all of this company now. I'm out. , you say you're number one in the market. I'm trying to understand this. Shouldn't have said that, Scott. . You said that the market is a million dollars. It's not a million dollars. He messed up. How do you not know the numbers, guy? . He Hold on, Robert. Robert, you shouldn't be making these mistakes and these assumptions. I'm out. , who do we have left here? Robert, you got to know the numbers. You can't come out and say, I own 90% of the market, and it turns out you might own 10%, 15%. I would to get into this business because I do think it's going to grow at 175,000. What possible offer could I give you that's reasonable from a pure numbers perspective? It's It's not a $1.2 $2 million business today. 175,000 for 50%. Would you consider that? I'd consider, but I wouldn't take it unfortunately. , from what we You better be working 16 hours a day on our business we do. Sorry, what did you say? I said you better be working 16 hours a day on our business we do for that money. , no. I work 24 hours a day in my business I could have the privilege of sitting up here and listening to people you. I'm out. , guys. I'll get to the point. I think your marketing is horrible. There's nothing that's going to demonstrate to me that your product is any different than the others. You're using berries to do your clothes. We sterilize ours. But that's the point. You may sterilize them, but there's nothing there that tells me that you do that. , you've completely left out your greatest differentiation. , the branding and the look of the boxes alone, when you look at how traditionally in the marketplace, when I look at the boxes, I'm going to know they're sterilized nuts at our size advertising out there in front of everybody. , look, here's this, here's that, here's the what we do differently until we're large enough to truly have our giving me excuses. I'm giving you a solid and valid reason of how we've managed to protect ourselves in business run rabid with dogs and managed to climb our way up to be number one. Congratulations be brought down. what? When you're done patting yourself on the back, you should look at your marketing and say the message this big board sends me is not going to educate me on the fact that you have a differentiated product product. You've completely left it out and now you've left me out. I'm out. . Hi, Shortcut. , let me tell you the best part about your pitch today is you are such a good couple. It only takes an hour to get married. my lord. I think the Econut's name is great. But beyond that, I don't think you present the product at all. ? I'm out. , thank you. , thank you much for letting us show everything. Wait, wait a minute. I also agree with Barbara that you did a genuinely terrible job, but she moved me with something she said. And I haven't done this before in Shark Tank, but I'm willing to do it today because I am Mr. Wonderful. Do you want me to marry you now? Can you marry us? Of course I can. I'm Mr. Wonderful. My parents would kill me. I'm sorry then. You leave with nothing. Leave them on the line. All , guys. , good luck.

I am from Portland, Oregon, and I am seeking $100,000 in exchange for 20% equity in my company. Sharks. The world has been through a lot of big changes these past few years. A big pandemic, a big recession. In fact, all of our problems have gotten too dang big. We need more cute in the world. It's time to think small. Smaller. Smaller. Smaller. That's what I'm talking about. Introducing Mini Materials. Authentic, highquality, modern miniature building supplies for dollhouse construction, diaramas, and two-scale recreations. We deliver joy by the pallet load. We use innovative techniques to bring high-quality products that are made in the USA. And they are as real as they are adorable. A real concrete, real wood, even real metal. Traditional dollhouse companies do Victorian molding. We do brief blocks. They do picket fences. We do jersey barriers. They do doilies and frills. We do moving dollies and pallet jackets. That's pretty good. We are not your grandmother's dollhouse company. We cater to a new generation of creatives who make art with fingerboards and action figures and RC crawlers. If your hobby is small, then we are the perfect fit. Now, Sharks, we don't to make guarantees about gains, but after one day with many materials, you will be able to lift an entire pallet of cinder blocks over your head with one hand. , Sharks, who wants to demolish a stagnant industry and make a big deal with many materials? That's great. Good job. Good job. Bravo. Why? Why does anybody need any of this? It's a toy. What are you talking about? Because people need joy. And everybody has some samples in front of them if you guys want to start playing. I'm here to answer questions when you're done playing with. , that's from someone who has had to wrap a lot of pallets. This is adorable. Thank you. When you said this is real concrete. Yeah. This is real. Yes. It's mortar. It's mortar. Yeah. cute. Look, even a little buzz sock. 15 years, never seen anything this. Super cute. How does it translate into sales? Give us an idea of when you started this and what occurred. I bought the business one year and one month ago. , . , the business has a lot to do with Reddit with the online form Reddit. Yeah. One of the original co-founders was looking on Reddit and somebody had handmade a concrete block and they were , \"That is awesome.\" And he started making them and then he put it on Reddit as saying look I have this whole pallet with cinder blocks and people were I love that. Went to the front page of our went to the front page of Reddit again. Dang. lo and behold pretty soon they had a healthy side business. I came across this post. Hey I have a business and I'm looking to sell it. I reached out via Reddit and ended up purchasing the company from them. What did you buy the business for? 200,000. And where did you get the money for that Jared? I took heliloc against my house. wow you you went all in. I did. I have been always wanting to start a business. What attracted me to this is it's making things. And what what are your margins on this? on an individual product basis they go from 50 to 93% with blended rate of about 75%. that's not bad at all. What are your sales? in the last year I've done $200,000 in sales. Good for you. Yeah. And you own it 100%. And you're making them? I make them. Yeah. How much does this sell for? , that one without the logo printed on it is $20. And what does it cost you to make this? $4. That's pretty pricey. , this is for enthusiasts or hobbyists that are probably a little more mature. Is this for children? ? , I'm trying to get the the the age 8 to 12 is what my packaging guidelines recommend. What's the average? I don't know if I have a hard number on that that I would be 100% confident in saying I I do know generally. generally what do you see on let's talk social media is that answer my question. because he doesn't know his demographic in that reason I'm out. what do you do with social media? I could see this doing a lot of stop action animation and stop animation. People do stop animation with things for sure. But are you doing any of that to increase sales? I am. But one of the reasons I'm here now is marketing is my biggest weakness as a company. I'm not horrible at it. Tell us about your background. I'm doing this full-time now. I grew up in rural Idaho, went to a two- room schoolhouse. and then after I graduated, I moved to Portland. I blinked and got up my first real professional job. Blinked and then was married. Blinked and had kids. Blinked and had a house. And life was flying by. And this desire to start a business was always there, but starting a business and not having sales seemed slightly irresponsible for having kids and having a mortgage. I love how you said that. , I blinked and 15 years later, two words have never been broken. Yeah. Life goes, \"You have a business.\" Are you making money on the 200,000? I am making money. Yes. Are you paying yourself? How much? I am paying myself. , far in that last year and a month, I have pulled out about 55,000 out of the business. Good for you. Good for you. , it's it's interesting. I can see a forever perpetual demand for it from a small segment of the market. Everything about it is small, . Yeah. And and that makes it a difficult investment for me cuz , I don't know how you blow this thing up. It's too small for me. Jared, I'm out. I'm sorry to hear that. I do think there is a lot of good upside. I think it's cute as can be. It's not a business for me, but I think it's a great business for you, and I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Thank you, Jared. I blinked and I've been here for 15 years. , what I've learned is if you have a good business, you can get it to 2 to 3 million by sheer willpower of your execution. You can make a fantastic living, but as an investor, I need to see more scale. I don't see it beyond that. , I'm going to be out for that. wish you all the best. I think there is upwards of room for Jared entrepreneurs are willing to take the pain of working working to avoid the pain of looking back when you're 70 80 90 years old and never had tried. Yes. And you get a ton of credit for going for it. I think this business can be successful, but because it's new in inventing a new industry in a lot of respects, it could take decades, ? And I know that you don't want to hear that sound of it. That's a lot of pain. But I I I'm not ready to go along for that long a ride. , for those reasons, I'm out. Everybody loves the product. Love it. You got to grind it out. Jared, it is cool. Jared, you have something here. And it'll never happen fast enough, but when you blink again, it could be a two, three, four million dollar business with a million dollars in your pocket. Yeah. All , man.

As a hairy brown girl with sensitive skin, I've left many waxing salons with less hair, but my skin my skin was collateral damage. Wall Shark's hair removal has never been sweeter. . Say hello to Sugar Dough. At home sugaring kits to remove any hair. We to say we got your back and your front, arms, legs, and anywhere else. Made with sugar, water, and citrus, our all natural sugar-based dough gently pulls hair from the root while exfoliating your skin, leaving feeling silky smooth. And it's a gentle, compostable alternative to waxing. , Sharks, I'm the sugar mama to sugar dough, I'm asking for some serious dough. I'm seeking $500,000 for 5% of the company. Wow. But first, come on, Kendra. My friend Rishot here is in need of some sugaring himself. Do you want to come up and be his sugar mama and sugar with me? I do. I get to remove. my gosh, this is exciting. Kevin's back. Baker do. Kevin's back. Yes, I know. Are you serious? This is my dream come true. , sugar dough is made with this taffy goop and it is fun to play with. It's similar to caramel or taffy. Made with similar ingredients as . . What do I do? , you can try on this side. . , all . Tell me if I'm doing this . . I'm going to mold it into your skin. I'm going to help I'm going to let it heat up a minute. Exactly. And I'm going to help it. And then you want to pull taut with the other hand. , pull the skin taut and then three, two, one. my god. You did a good job, Kendra. That's satisfying. Awesome. I'm going to dismiss Resot. Thank you much. Good job, buddy. Try to wrap my head around the 500,000 5% 10 million valuation. This innovation is ancient. It was found in Phoenician times. Women have been using it forever. Yes. All through the Mediterranean. Yes. And there's zero proprietary elements to it. Anybody can do this. help me, help me, help me get to $10 million. We've worked two years to create a proprietary manufacturing process and also our own formulation. that's where we have some of our own IP to be able to you do your process is the IP. Yes. Exactly. now would be a good time to tell us a little about sales. Sales. Yes. Sales. Sales. I would love to tell you about our sales. I launched in September 2020 as a solo entrepreneur and at that point at the end of the year I made 50k in revenue. Got it. Fast forward to 2021 we went viral on Tik Tok and we made $2.6 million in sales. From 50,000 to 2.6 50,000 to 2.6. That's what I'm talking about. And then last year we ended the year in $5.6 million in sales. Wow. , we first started in D TOC and then we grew to Amazon and then at the end of 2022 we made it in 300 Ulta beauty stores. Last year we expanded full nationwide and into 1300 stores and that's where we had that big bump in sales. Did you make money on the 5.6? No, we didn't make money. How's that possible? We didn't make money. in order to make profits in retail, we learned the hard way that you need 85 90% margins. Our margins were around 60%. However, this year we updated our suppliers and we implemented our manufacturing process and our margins are now hovering around 80%. Did you lose money or? Yes, we lost money last year. How much did you lose? We ended the year at 777%. you lost $440ome,000. How did you fund all those losses? Me and my husband invested $400,000 of our personal money. But you lost more. You lost 400. then that's that goes into our debt that we have now. How much debt do you have? We have $1.5 million. Hello. There we go. Yeah. We also have $1 million in inventory. But it also means that you have no cash now. We have no cash now. That's why I'm here in the Shark Tank. Yeah. That is what you need. That is what I need now. Yeah. Especially if we want to get into more retailers. You can't afford to go into more retailers. We have debt financing which is at a high interest rate of 22%. Wow. Hello. That means where it is. your total debt is 1.5. Yeah. That's what's killing us now is because 20% of the money that we borrow is out the door. We had all this money tied up in inventory and now we're sizing. much has changed in the last few months. Going through hyperrowth you did. Yeah. Is hard. Yes. borrowing money to get there put you even further underwater because you're always it feels you can never catch up and and get even . Yeah. I wish I had a way where I could say here you go. This is the approach. But I thought when I walked in and saw it I thought this was food and I got hungry. I don't know this stuff at all. for those reasons I'm out. But I wish you the best. . Thank you Mark. I appreciate it. The ask is too big without even fighting about the valuation. I would never value this at 10 million now. You've got sales. I that. But you got a long way to go. It It's, , if you'd come in here for 100, 150, even 200, maybe I take the ride, change the valuation a bit, but this is nuts. I think it's nuts. , for that reason, I'm out. Thank you, Kevin. Yeah. , it's hard because you couldn't predict that you were going to go this high and then as soon as you got that that level, , you had to learn what you didn't know, ? the the amount of margin on these things and then you got to borrow money against it. You can't leave Ultra empty-handed when they asking for goods. Yeah. But , to give you $500,000 for 5% you would have to distribute $10 million. if you going if you're doing , that's to get your money back. If you to get my money back, that means you probably would have to do in this model $50 million. You'd be older than the Phoenetians that invented this by the time you got your money back. I'm out. Thank you much, Aaliyah. You're amazing, by the way. And I, , as you were talking, I've been there. , I made some of these same mistakes. I did my business on a line of credit. I was bootstrapping everything. I had credit card debt. , I it was hard to get anybody to invest in me, ? I know how what that feels . But what you're accomplishing is , exciting. , you went from 28 to 56. , I love what you're doing. This is not my business and I'm a little worried about the amount of debt that you have. Honestly, , before you say no, I'm willing to make a deal and that's why I'm here. I have worked my butt off for the last four years and grown super fast to be able to get to the point where I'm at now. And I would partnership and you are Sharks. You guys love problems. This is a great problem to solve. Not sure we we don't know if we love problems. We love solving solving problems. Y'all are problem solvers. you wouldn't be here. The 500 that's a big ask and and it's not even going to put even a little bit of damp on what you've already got to deal with, ? It's not going to solve a lot of problems. But I do admire you. I'm out. . Thank you. I appreciate it. One of the things that concerns me truly is the competitive market. And I wish you good luck, but I'm sorry I'm out. . All . Thank you guys much. I appreciate it.

We're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Sharks, this toilet stands before you today guilty of a terrible crime. Murder. That's . This porcelain perpetrator is the number one reason people lose phones to water damage. It doesn't stop there. Toilets, swimming pools, washing machines. Each year in the US, these kill 22 million phones with water damage. We've invented a machine that can bring phones, tablets, laptops, watches, anything that fits in the chamber back to life. It's not magic. It's science. Have a look inside our machine in real time. Transforming liquid into gas. Restoring your phone in 30 minutes. No need to disassemble or take anything apart. Sharks, this is my personal phone. It has no special protection, but I'm not worried. And I'm not worried. You murderer. , let's make a deal. Sharks. This is one opportunity you don't want to flush away. gosh. I'm going to take a moment to rescue this phone and then show you our process. This is a gut-wrenching moment for customers. Bring it in for service as quick as you can. Your device starts rusting as soon as it gets wet. , inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. , I feel it's a heart attack. You got to get CPR fast, ? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. ? , technically someone could ship it to you. , are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as as we have a mail-in service. But what are your sales? last year with a few stores we did $29,000 82 stores, ? We're talking about last year. Sorry, did you say that last year you sold the incredible amount of how much? $29,000 in sales with a few stores. We focused on making the economics on a per store basis profitable. . And then we launched to 82 stores and only two months later we've been asked to launch to 600 stores. What were your sales after the balance of the stores? this year we're on track with the expansion to hit $650,000. you go to a store and you say, \"Put this in for free or do they pay you?\" , you don't pay unless it works. They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? , in the in the beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? , on average, it works out to about $80 rent a month. Wait, $80 rent per month you're charging them. And then on top of that, we get a rev share, a percentage of the revenue. What's the percentage? On average, it's about 16%. , in order to do all this, you had to have raised a bunch of capital. We've raised 2.2 million far. Wow. Wow. And what was the value of the company post money? It had a valuation cap of 4.8 million. why is your valuation high? This is about getting to $800 per month per store. That's $6 million in revenue and $3.5 million in profit. But you're not doing that today. No. But if you discount that back from when we will be doing it, that's still far above $10 million. And what do you place as a value on that risk in case you don't execute? , honestly, I see you totally as an online business. You said you have three days, , in which it can still survive. We have an online market, but we haven't been able to afford national marketing for the online. I don't understand why you think you want to go retail. I don't see the big market. I'm out. Thank you. You came in asking for a $10 million valuation and I don't know how you're going to make that back that fast. And , unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. I think technology is your enemy. I was reading something the other day that the new Apple phone is almost totally water resistant. , I think the technology improvements can put you out of business by the time you figure out your model. Wouldn't put my money there amount. Guys, look, I the idea. I the concept, but you you're going to have to keep on raising capital. And unless I gave you that capital, I'm going to keep on getting diluted. The problem is how do I get my money back? , one of the reasons I think we're going to succeed is not because we may have a good plan. It's because we have an awesome team. Have you ever heard anybody start a company, hire their people, and say, \"We have a horrible team.\" That's not enough. I'm out. , everybody's out. Mr. Wonderful's left. I the story. I understand the model. I I don't want to argue about your valuation. I think it's too high. I'm going to loan you this 500k at 13%, but I'm taking the 5% as an equity warrant. That's the value I bring as a shark to this. , I want it paid back in 36 months. What do you think of this offer? Would you be willing to go more than 500,000 now? You asked for 500. That's the deal I would do. And I'm the only shark here today willing to give you an offer. , what do you want to do? All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We'll take that deal. Congratulations, guys. Thank you much. That's terrific. Thank you much. Sounds Kevin. Let's see how your new investment works. Do it, Mark. That's great. , God. All , guys. Thanks. Do it. You got to have confidence. Do it.

the co-founder of firefighter 1 today I am seeking $150,000 for 15% Equity of my company how many of you somebody who's Lost Property due to fire been evacuated or had a fire scare themselves increasing temperatures and drop our limiting resources and devastating wildfires are taking over many parts of our country as a homeowner you don't have many options if there's a fire you could evacuate and hope that the fire department has enough resources to help protect your property or you could grab a garden hose and spray your roof and perimeter hoping for the best that's what my dad would see people doing while watching news coverage of the wildfires every single year he knew there had to be a better way many of those homes ours had pools it got them thinking what about fast access to pool water and firefighter 1 was born firefighter 1 is the first affordable resource designed for Pool owners to quickly access the average 25,000 gallons of cool water in seconds if there ever is a fire you grab your firefighter one hose from its thir location connect our adapter to your pool pump that grab the nozzle be ready turn the pump on AIM and in less than 30 seconds spray valuable pool water a distance of 40 ft at a rate of 80 Gall per minute that's pretty cool this is a 35 ft roof line and about 7 minutes you could drench the entire property wow sharks together we could keep proper prop safer from fire and I can continue building the firefighter one Legacy for my dad that's cool what happens if you've been if you've been instructed to evacuate if you've been instructed to evacuate you evacuate but a lot of times a fire is a couple miles in the distance and Embers fly over a mile the fires jump you could wet the property before you're evacuated or in other instances a backyard barbecue something happens and you want to put that out before a fire spreads are you selling the hose I'm selling the hose with the adapter you already have the pump that pump is a standard pump in every pool this is standard our adapter is not standard what you do is you have your pool person install the three-way valve it takes only about 15 minutes it takes some proactive you're going to have to get your pool guy or pool girl or whatever but then you leave it that way and then you leave it and many people already have these installed with an open port for an outpout when you have those which ends up being about 25% of my customers you add our adapter onto that three-way valve and you're good to go what do you sell it for and what does it cost you to make this 50ft unit I sell for $4.99 it cost me about $124 to build it and that's now I'm only building about 25 to 30 units out of time I could definitely increase my margins the 100t sells for $3.99 and it cost me about $200 to make educate me I was assuming when these fires come through that it's Timber and a lot of things falling onto the property that is something that a drenched property would not solve that but you're saying it's The Embers that's a huge problem it's the flying Embers because the Embers fly more than a mile they hit another roof line they hit some dry patches trees they hit a bunch of trash anything catches and then it starts large pieces of yep pieces of debris that are flying and they'll pick up air and then they wind the worse it is I'm curious you talked about your father but this is his invention I would love to hear about you your background and your father this was his idea I said we were in Southern California and we every single year would have different fires occurring and one day he looked at the pool and he said why don't we have access obviously a lot of us have pools he started looking into it and there are some big pumps where you could buy a separate engine and drop it into the pool but they're expensive and many people can't afford to spend thousands of do on something he came up with firefighter one we we were kids he passed a little bit over 5 years ago I started redeveloping it can the firemen use your product in some way to help them to fight the fires by draining pools if they needed to absolutely the goal in the long term is that fire departments would know where every single one of these is and they could use it and I'm surprised Kevin L didn't ask you this let's let's hear it what are your sales we launched this Fe 2022 my cash flow is $22,000 in sales and how many units is that I've sold 49 units yeah under 50 units you're starting the sales are generally small but that doesn't mean anything it means they're small no where did the sales come from I've been partnering with pool companies because they already have the relationship with Pool owners and are you paying them a commission exactly I pay them if they sell units themselves on a commission base they get 20% if I have a pool store who's buying inventory it's 25 to 30% off whol steale depending on how many units they buy I love the space of helping people stay safe it means a lot to me but I feel that this is not a place where I could add enormous value regretfully I'm out but I wish you the best look Bianca not every business is investable because you're you're nent you're early you're figuring out how to sell it it has Merit but I my feeling is I could make hundreds of dollars you can make millions of dollars and a c you have to prove that for that reason I'm out I think you're on the path to success by figuring it out small I don't know anything about this you see you were educating me I don't think I add value I think a lot of people need this but I wouldn't be able to help you I'm out thank you Bianca listen in my opinion I feel this is the type of product that needs a lot of mouthpieces behind it and promotion and I think this is one of these things that Mark if you're willing to go in with me I think that we'll help figure it out let me ask a question are you patient I'm patient and I'm hardworking this is a patience business to Lori's Point some of the greatest changes entrepreneurial changes took time absolutely it's going to take time for people to understand this it's going to take time time for word to get out but the good thing about this business there's a lot of great leverage points yes because all the pool Services all throughout California the minute there's a wildfire and someone's home is threatened all of a sudden they understand it Mark she's asking for 150,000 for 15% we're going to have to do a bit of work to to help you here be slow burn you're going to need a lot of us I understand that 150,000 for 25% for 25% for both of you for both you don't let that hose get away don't let that hose get away would you guys do it for 20% for both of you no no I could tell by your faces you have a deal you have a deal yes no you have a deal I need to do it for sure we need to help this gosh I'm excited than thank you thank you guys congratulations congrats it means to start working to start getting firefighter one to people and to start showing my dad that he did not disappoint he didn't let us know and that we're going to help people yes\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:**

I'm the founder and CEO of Cardio, a gamified fitness app, and I am seeking 150,000 for 5% of my company. Sharks. Cardio sucks. Maybe you're a treadmill guy or girl who doesn't love running in place, staring out of a window or at a wall while numbers stick up on a display. Great time. hamster life or maybe the jump rope cuz who doesn't love jumping in place staring at a wall looking semi athletic hopefully as you sweat for five to 10 minutes hoping you're burning some calories but today I am here to do the impossible make cardio suck a whole lot less and we're doing that with cardio a gamif of five fitness app turning your outdoor cardio into a giant game of turf war let me show you how that works let's say you're an athletic guy Mark and you decide you're going to go for a run today of course Mark's going to do his four miles it's pretty Easy for the Cuban man. And as you finish, you'll see the area town you ran through. But Lori, always wanted to steal a deal, decides that she wants to run that same exact area to show markup. It's turning it into a giant game of turf war. Think capture the flag, but where the city streets, neighborhood roads, and hiking trails are areas that you compete to claim against other people in your city as a team. , as you see here, as Lori moves to this area, that'll go from cardio green to Shark Tank Blue while tracking all of her stats. And as you move, you'll see that the Shark Tank logo will start to move into the places that the cardio team used to have it. Now, once Lori decides to finish up her run, of course, going a little bit faster than Mark, she's going to finish up, see all of her stats, and then she'll end her route. That'll upload into our system. She'll be able to see tracker for all the places and ties that she's run. Now, let's flash back to Mark. He'll see that Shark Tank logo didn't used to be there. and he'll go to his phone and say, \"Wow, Lori stole 109 blocks from my team.\" He'll click on that, see the specific areas of town that Lori went through, how fast she went, and to get it back, you guessed it, he's going to have to go out there and start hauling his butt over that way. Sharks, who wants to get out of the pool and hit the streets with me and the cardio crew? , how are you navigating separating yourself from other apps? That's where the gamification comes in, ? Yeah, I'm glad you asked that. with these other trackers, they are focused on usually goal oriented performance-based running. With our app, we incorporate social gamification and dynamicism where every time you go out there, the map looks a little bit different. It's a sports game. Do I want to run the same route I did before? I have a person on my team who ran that route. Maybe I should go to a different part of town. We got 22,000 users in 70 countries. And we've had people tell us we do. We have 22,000 users in 70 countries. we have 14,000 active 400 run clubs that have signed up their groups and one corporate wellness pilot with Oracle. Are those free downloads? What what is the revenue model? premium model. We bring people in. Again, most of you didn't know what I even meant by a turf war. thing is we got to get them in get them to fall in love with it. The retention rates have shown they have. We have a 34% day 30 retention. Are those free downloads or subscription? walk me through this. Yeah. Free downloads. Free downloads. Even the premium subscriptions which where the revenue comes from is from those groups. I said, it's a team-based game. Most teams, $25 a month. We target run clubs with organized dues and memberships. What was your revenue last month? Last month, $4,000. . , how are you going to get that from 4,000 to 400,000? The biggest thing now is opening the doors to the places that we need to be. We have already partnered with the San Francisco Marathon, Austin Marathon, and the When you say when you say partnership, yes. What what does that entail? These are run clubs that are using as a way to engage and track data, which is why we've incorporated the ability to schedule events. , you're able to schedule and say, \"Hey, we're going to go on a run at Peace Park at 7 p.m. They have the ability to have a team chat. Kudos for people to say, \"Hey, nice run.\" , that's cool there, ? Because how much have you raised far? Started the business June 2022. We have raised 470K as of now. Primarily that was from 150k in grants from Pok\u00e9mon Go. Wow. I sent I got this idea during co I was broke as a joke. I was living in my car in Austin, Texas trying to figure this out. I'm not an engineer. I tried to teach myself how to. Didn't work . Wouldn't have looked as nice as it did here. I started DMing engineers. I DM' 400. All of them said no. But one of them was a founding engineer for Pok\u00e9mon Go and he loved my Moxy. He said, \"I'm going to drop the CEO of Pok\u00e9mon Go's email here. Do what you want with it. I'm not allowed to make an intro, but I can give it to you. Shoot your shot.\" , I shot him an email. This is May of 2021. Two months later, he responded. Here's the funny part. I got on a call. He wasn't on it. It was three of his other people. And they only took the call because he made him take it. Then they said no. But I said, \", I know you read them now.\" , I sent him a email every week for the next three months until eventually he said, \"All , kid. Here's a 50k grant. Get out of my inbox and keep working on it.\" Let me tell you, that's brilliant. And I hate you because now everybody out there is going to send us 600 emails a week. That is amazing. I always say the dream is free and the hustle sold separately. Love it. . the only problem that I have here is that there are two things that are not in my wheelhouse at all. Running and gaming. I would not bring enough benefit to what you're doing. I'm sorry. I'm out. That's all . Thank you, Lori. By the way, my mom says you're her favorite. But you're all her second favorite. You're all her second favorite. How did you come up with the 3 million valuation? 150k 5%. I got that valuation from the fact that investors wrote us those same terms that we've raised on currently as of last month. But more importantly, I'm projecting the future of where we're going to be. The thing you're buying today is not going to be worth what it's worth today forever. Everybody that's ever stood there said the same thing when and some of them were and I think I'm one of them. That's a good answer. That's true. It's not a deal for me. It's not a deal for me. Your 4K is it's the beginning of proof of concept. I don't think there's enough data for me to pull the trigger on this interesting presentation. I'm out. The problem with this business is you are always stressed because if you don't have critical mass, the whole thing doesn't work. But the thing is the critical mass is created through the team signing up. It's not about them competing against other teams. It's I have a group of people. No, I get that. . . But you've got to keep enough teams or everybody thinks there's there's no app, ? Or that it doesn't work. But I don't know how I can help you scale that. . I don't see it as a fit for me, my guy. I'm I'm sorry. , for those reasons, I'm out. All . Thanks, Mark. Appreciate you, man. What is driving you to be successful now? What is that thing that's inside of you that's pushing you? My mom is out there now. I I used to have a bad lisp and a stutter and I was a bad public speaker. When I was 10 years old, I was watching the show before you were even on it, Mark. And my mom said, \"I want you to watch the show and see how people present.\" And I watched it every Friday and Sunday for the first from 10 to 16. At 16 is when I first started to get in the business. And I told my mom, \"We're going to be on this show one day, mom. And I'm going to bring you.\" She's back there waiting for me to give her a deal. I love that. I love that. And I'm creating generational wealth and I want my kids to have something. I'm here to do that. And I told my mom I wouldn't walk out of here with a deal. what do you want from me, Rashan? , I I want to go in with with Damon because I I think you're a great salesperson and I think you can become a good business person. I think you need mentors, you need strategy, you need access to capital and I've done over a hundred software investments. That's my thing and I enjoy doing it and I enjoy mentoring young founders, especially guys that remind me of myself that have that grit. I got to be part of this and I and I I don't care how I'm part of this. And I love your energy. I did the same thing. I did it with a phone, , 40 years ago. I made 50 calls a day for 6 months until people picked up and the first half of them said no and 3 months later they said you're not going anywhere and I said nope and then they started to write checks or recommend me to go other places. I love that. 1 plus 1 equals 5 in this situation here. Now keep that in mind. . 150,000 but we need 15%. . Why are you waiting? How would you feel about 10%. Dustin, I love it though. I love the guy. Dustin, come on, man. No, but I love the guy's hustle. I love it. , I'm going to repeat. 15% for $150,000 and you're going to get 10 more things cuz you're going to get Damon and By the way, I can hear your mother screaming, \"Take the deal, Bozo.\" Yes, I can, too. Take the deal. I have one question to ask you. All . And I don't want the deal to be gone if I ask it. Can I go talk to my mom? I think you should bring your mom out. I think she needs to go to get my mom. She's going to say Jake the deal. Mom, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. All . A Come here. I love this guy. Come here. Come here. Hey, mom. She's my sister. Clearly. Hey, Mom. Mom, you heard all that, ? Hi, Mom. What do you think? What do you What do you What do you think? You're . I was back there saying, \"Boy, let's do the deal.\" Mom, talk some sense into your son. Let's do the deal. Rashan Damon, you got a deal.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Austin, Texas (GPE), 5%, 34%, 150k 5%, 15%, about 10% (PERCENT), five to 10 minutes, 7 p.m. (TIME), four miles (QUANTITY), Cuban (NORP), 25, 4,000, 150,000 (MONEY), Peace Park (FAC), Moxy (PRODUCT), second, first (ORDINAL), Bozo (WORK_OF_ART)\n\n**Key Phrases:** my mom, a deal, the deal, a giant game, turf war, a run, her stats, the places\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 do: that\n  \u2022 see: area town\n  \u2022 turn: it\n  \u2022 incorporate: gamification\n  \u2022 have: person\n  \u2022 get: users\n  \u2022 have: users\n  \u2022 have: run clubs\n  \u2022 bring: people\n  \u2022 have: retention\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.16)\n\n**Topics:** mom, deal, thing, team, cardio",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi, I'm Abby Jordan. And I'm Becky App. We're E Crearyy Ice Cream and GileTo. And we're asking for $250,000 for 33% equity in our company. Who doesn't love ice cream? However, no one in the $23 billion ice cream industry is positioning ice cream as a gift. Sharks, the days of sending flowers are over. Here's how it works. Step one, visit our website where you rule the scoop. Step two, design your flavor. Do you want ice cream, gelato, or sorbetto? Choose from over 50 flavors. Even choose your mixins from chocolate fudge brownies to bacon. Step three, name your flavor. For instance, Lily's Feel Better Bites. And step four, we deliver it to your doorstep. , Sharks, as we propose our sweet deal, please enjoy your own personalized flavor we've made for you. We have Robert's investment mix, Barbett's Delicious Dividends, Mr. Wonderful's Shark Bait, Damon's Fashionable Flavor Factory, and last we have the Cubanero Dark Chocolate Aanero Servetto. That sounds me. [Music] Wow, that is good. It's a delicious deal, ? That's delicious. Amazing. Heavy ice cream. It's creamy. Good. , ladies. $750,000 valuation. Do you have any sales? We've sold $2 million since inception at the end of 2007. Wow. Wow. , what about this year? We're on track to do $750,000. And how much money will you make on that? $60,000. Why are the margins low? They're not low. They're 60% margins. the why? Where's all the money going? 750,000 in sales. You're only making 60,000 on that. We have spent significant amount of money into building a solid infrastructure. This is a great time for you guys to be involved. This is the tipping point. We have invested into our machinery, into tried and trueue recipes, the process of shipping ice cream, which isn't as easy as it may seem. How do you ship it without it melting? We ship it in a reusable cooler on dry ice. How much does that cost? We sell a 4pint ice cream gift for an average of $55 on our site plus shipping. Shipping, ? , second day air is $25. Who pays for that? The customer. The customer pays for they end up paying $75 for the gift. 80. Yes. Even as a gift, $80 is , expensive for four pints of ice cream. What we to say is the last time you sent flowers, what did you spend? That's exactly the point. I don't think that's expensive because every time I do something wrong, my wife yells at me, I'm spending at least $250 for roses. We have an all apologies pack of ice cream. , you do. You make the ice cream yourself? Yes. Yes. Why? we said before, you can't look at this as 16 ounces of cream and sugar. This is a personalized, heartfelt message. And I maybe I should direct the conversation. I know how you feel about that. I love the idea. , I think if you sell it as ice cream, it's expensive. But if you sell it as a lifestyle experience, it's not. . What are you doing for customer acquisition? And what is your cost per customer acquisition? We are spending all of our marketing budget on online advertising. What does it cost you to get a customer? $20 a customer, but that customer is going to repeat purchase. How many times? now, average customers are purchased about twice a year. . And my profit on a customer, our margins are 60%. But let's step back. You said you were a lifestyle guys. How did you get into this business? With our investor, we purchased a nonfunctioning ice cream website. We rebuilt it and repositioned it as an ice cream gift site. How much does your investor own of the company? 70%. 70. And how much how much did they put in? He put in 600,000. Was it Warren Buffet? Gave you close to a million dollar valuation from a concept about ice cream. He is a venture capitalist. He is successful in in the e-commerce space. He wants one of you guys, I'm sure. And you are offering us 33% of the company. Does this investor is he aware of this? Absolutely. He's looking his share. It's of his share. We want your capital and your connections cuz we know that we can take this to the next level. What do you think it's going to take to get you to the next level? We want the capital for a production facility. We make and ship and sell everything out of our ice cream parlor. Is there value today to have a retail bricks and mortar presence and an online presence? In other words, if you shut down the retail, would the online be more profitable? Yes, it would. I'm getting intrigued. I have to admit, I'll make you an offer because I also value promotion. I don't know which of the other shark or sharkettes would be interested, but I'll give you 125,000 for 25%. But the price is 250. I heard that. . , he needs a partner, Barbara. That's such a bogus strategy, though. If you it, , if you want to be in, you can be in. If not, be quiet. If you want it, 250K. Nope. , another shark. I think the problem with this deal is the cost of customer acquisition is huge. They need a massive amount of promotion. I think the problem with the deal is they have one of the guys us behind them. I'm not going to give up my money and my time for somebody else who owns 70% of the company. I'm out. I love the idea. But you got online, you got bricks and mortar, you got another investor. There's too much going on. We're ready to focus on the online. We know that's what's going to scale. To Robert's point, the best idea here that I've heard is to shut down your store. I don't think you need a partner here. I think you need a loan of some kind. I'm out. We're disappointed. We were looking forward to I would love to have these partners, but I would never get my money out and I would start to hate you. , nasty. Wow. This is a tough sale, girls. I'm throwing a bone out here and nobody's biting. Mark, where are you at? I think it's a brilliant idea. Thank you. But there's a saying that I love. It says, \"First there's the innovators, then there's the imitators, then there's the idiots.\" You're the innovator. The problem is you haven't been imitated yet because it's such a good idea. you will be. As you get more successful, people are going to say, \" what? I can do this locally. I don't have the $25 shipping cost.\" For that reason, I'm out. You have one shark left to deal with. The meanest guy. That's the good news. The bad news is it's Kevin. It's Kevin. , all good roads lead to uncle. And he's only giving you half the money. The reason I did that is I figure this thing is a massive promotional challenge because you're educating America that ice cream is a gift. And by the way, it's good. The best ice cream I've ever had. Yeah, it is fantastic. We're we're going to make this a $5 million business in the next 3 years. Ladies, I have bad news. Please consider mashing the offer we can build a protection. Because of the green of these other sharks, I'm stuck. I can't do anything. What are you going to do? I'm out. Thank you for tasting it, for trying it, for loving it. Good luck. Terrific job. Thank you.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** E Crearyy Ice Cream, Lily's Feel Better Bites, the Cubanero Dark Chocolate Aanero Servetto, Warren Buffet (ORG), 33%, 60%, 70%, 25% (PERCENT), second, First (ORDINAL), four pints, 16 ounces (QUANTITY), America (GPE)\n\n**Key Phrases:** ice cream, a gift, customer acquisition, the company, the problem, your flavor, you guys, the customer\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 love: ice cream\n  \u2022 position: ice cream\n  \u2022 send: flowers\n  \u2022 visit: website\n  \u2022 design: flavor\n  \u2022 want: ice cream\n  \u2022 choose: mixins\n  \u2022 name: flavor\n  \u2022 deliver: it\n  \u2022 enjoy: flavor\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.18)\n\n**Topics:** ice, cream, customer, gift, shark",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nHi, my name is Tanya Patruno and I'm twotime Super Bowl champion Brandon Jacobs and my company is Pro Energy. I'm here seeking $250,000 in exchange for 15% equity. Pro Energy is a unique protein infused flavored water. It's all natural and great tasting with no fat, no caffeine, and no sugar. In one 4 oz bottle, there are 15 g of whey protein, essential vitamins, and an energy blend. It's balanced no matter how active your lives are. I didn't get to where I am by playing a half a game. I got to where I am by playing a whole game at a , high level. And Pro Energy has done that for me. I was overweight and many people, I bought into all the products and gimmicks that claim to melt the weight off. The truth is, I was frustrated with the results. , I set out to create my own answer. And I brought it down to the basics. Rehydrate, replenish, refresh. I hustled my way through doors and I got Pro Energy into over 3,000 stores in the New York area. Wow. Wow. Sharks, I need your investments to fill my purchase orders and propel Pro Energy onto a national market. I'd for you each to have a try you can experience what Pro Energy will do for you. . Wow. What? Why does it taste bad? Tastes bad. Yeah. Tastes chemically. I don't think it's bad at all. Do you ever take protein products? No. That There it is. That's the difference. Yeah. Believe me, this is something that tastes . Tanya, what am I buying here? Do I get a boost? Am I trying to get jacked up? Am I trying to lose weight? It's the only one of its kind. ProE Energy simplifies what your body needs. Is this a Gatorade or a Red Bull? It's not either either one of those. Is it a weight loss product? These guys have never been in a gym, they they don't understand. This is a compliment to a workout. You want to rehydrate and you also want protein to rebuild your muscles. , Mark, shouldn't Pro Nerk tell me that? It's Pro Energy. Pro NRG. NRG. . What? , a great name. Pro Nerk. No. Pro Energy. Listen, it's all fun and games Brandon come over and crack your head open. No, I'm I'm not. And I will give you the money. I will give you the money for that. , ? Yeah, baby. Put the ring on, too, when you do it. , Brandon, you're obviously a businessman. , why do you guys need the capital? To get a two-time Super Bowl champion as part of my team. , I brought Brandon on, but I'm not looking for him to be an investor. You guys are business businessmen. Why isn't he an investor? because I am an endorser. Who do you play for? San Francisco 49ers. And what position do you play? Running back. Played the last seven years with the twotime Super Bowl champions New York Giants. I don't know if you had it when you were with the Giants or are you going to have it in the Niners locker room? We had it with the Giants throughout the playoff run and we went to Indianapolis to play in the Super Bowl. Those guys, they loved it. Guys would share and bottles drank half and another guy drank half of that. it it it was it was crazy. You guys had a big old comeback, ? Second half. Was that the difference? I couldn't tell you if that was the reason why. I know. I know. I know. I know. But they loved it. I that you're not giving us the BS, but you believe in it. I that. Tell us about the economics of the business, what your sales are, how business is going in general. I have invested $75,000. It cost me a$110 to make per bottle, but those costs will be significantly dropped once I reach certain benchmarks in quantity. What do you sell to the wholesaler for? 180. , I hate it. , you're making 70 cents margin, but still it's not horrible. And what does it retail for? $3.99. , good margin for them, bad margin for you. Tanya, you realize that your distributors are making more money than you? , that's upside down. That's what life is in hell. You have to make more money than they do. That's crazy. You got to pay your dues in whatever business you're in. You're not worried about it cuz you're not on the P&L side. You're taking it off the top. I, as an investor, would be concerned about those margins. That's how I get my money back. And what retailers? We're in all the delies and markets that flood in Manhattan and also big box retailers. You told us you're in 3,000 stores. How much have you sold in the last year? . We've been in the on the market for about 3 months now. We've done 126,000 in sales. 120,000 in sales in 3 months. Yes. I'm surprised Tanya, you haven't been slaughtered yet. Somehow you've survived. Maybe the partnerships. I don't know. But you are not worth $1.7 million under any scenario. You've got way too much to prove. Good luck to you. But I'm out. Yep. Here's what I see. You've got a great idea, great product. You've got a great angle because you've got Brandon in New York. Now he's going to go out to San Francisco. That's not the challenge. The challenge is never the first act. It's the NFL. The NFL stands for not for long for a lot of people. . Outstanding. He's absolutely correct. It's the same thing in your business here. The hard part is the second act. After the newness wears off, after someone tries to knock you off and comes out with super pro NRG, then that's the hard part. I hate businesses where everybody and their brother is trying to get in. To me, if you're looking where everybody else is looking, you're looking in the wrong spot. I try to go where people aren't. , for that reason, I have to say I'm out. Kenya, you failed to be clear as to what the product was. After a lot of conversation, even when I look at your packaging here, it's even confusing as a standalone. And I want to make a note about Brandon. I don't think you utilize him at all. He's great. The first time he engaged me was when he told his locker room story. I'm picturing this pitch all over and him coming out and him starting it and say, \"I was in my locker room and we were losing the Super Bowl.\" Then I hit the pro nerd. Wham! Wham! Anything that pro energy, but because of their confusion of your message alone, which I think you've got to clean up, I'm out. Tanya, you've done a amazing job. I don't think we've ever had anybody out here that's been in business for the amount of time you have with the distribution that you have. , it's unbelievable. You must be the best salesperson we've ever met. But, , my concern is besides the cash, I think you need somebody who understands this space. For me, it's an energy drink space. It's not something I want to compete in, , for that reason. , don't say it. I'm out. . Tanya, there are four sharks out. Only one remains. Damon. , Damon. Listen, , my challenges with this, I think, is what all the sharks have have vocalized. , , high valuation. Such a a hard market to get into. But the good side of it is that I invested in a a bunch of CrossFits. I'm starting to understand how much people want this type of stuff. I forbid you to pay 1.7 million for this. I forbid you. I'm going to give you $250,000 for 30%. But that is contingent on me taking it to a protein and supplement company that I have a partnership with called Badass and closing a deal with them. And Brandon, I need you in the room telling that Super Bowl story to help us sell this thing. Gotcha. in case you hadn't noticed, the Shark Damon has cut your value in half.

seeking $400,000 for 10% of our company sharks let's be honest showering with a partner sounds fun but in reality [Music] it sucks one person's hogging all the hot water and the other's left shivering in the corner sure two showerheads would solve the problem but am I going to spend thousands of dollars on a renovation now you don't have to introducing bu's tandem shower tandem is the only easy and costeffective way to add a second shower head to your bathroom it optimizes the water pressure using our Custom Engineered shower head tandem installs in minutes it's simple all you have to do is extend the rod add the valve and connect the shower heads that's it no fancy contractors no knocking down walls it's an instant Spa upgrade sharks we're done showering on our own tandem is way more fun with a partner and we're looking for a long-term romance with one of you all Hannah David Shower four times over sharks we've got some samples of Tandem in front of you and we'd welcome your questions how about the pressure do you divide the pressure in two the pressure first thing that we thought about and the main thing is we have 5,000 customers and our average rating is 4.7 out of five but what about the pressure yeah we could speak to the pressure I think the point more for us is the pressure was always a top of Mind concern for any customer and it was great for us to see that the rating hit 4.7 five ,000 people bu over over 5,000 customers far over what period of time we did pre-order first and that started in April 2022 I'm surprised you have that many is this that big a problem yeah it's not a problem but it's an opportunity one thing I think one thing that's interesting is we went live in July and we started posting some some content on social media and we ended up blowing up we hit 50 million views on Tik Tok and 50 million views on Instagram and have over 50,000 followers on both platforms and a mailing list of over 40,000 people wow you must have some sales why don't you walk us through the business the sales off the kickstarter were 750,000 wow how many units is that about 3,000 something what do you think you'll do this calendar year and will you make any money we think we're going to do 1.7 because we have done it's all organic this year once we went live we blew up how much you going to make on 17 our gross profit margin is 71% but but what's your net profit what your profit is 54% net profit is 54 you're going to make good for you you think you're going to make over $850,000 yeah why does this item cost we have the first skew is $249 and that's with one of our showerheads then the second SK why would you even sell that a lot of customers are married to their handheld shower or maybe they purchase a shower head that they and they're not ready to commit to our aesthetic and performance what is the other skew cost the two together is $2.99 the single head can you walk me through the cost landed cost of that one and then the dual head what's the landed cost of that one $69 landed for the first one it's we averaged it they're co9 landed for both skews is what you're saying that's you're making money on every single sale now that's yeah what's your ultimate goal out of this we want to build a brand I think we have a lot of Ip around this product but we're not banking the business on it the next obvious opportunity for us is that the handhelds we have tons of customers that aren't converting it's a d of this you're going to stay in the shower St for sure for the beginning we are tandem focused when do you think you'll hit 5 million in sales next year next year yeah I don't buy it as a company yet I see it as a interesting Innovation as a product and some of the greatest deals in Shark Tank history is when the entrepreneur focused on that one application and maxed it out maxed that's our Focus now I'm not sure you were telling me about building a business other SKS a brand strategy which scares me that's the biggest mistake startups make they want to be a brand as opposed to executing on selling their product builds because what builds a brand is your execution totally what too many companies do I'm doing brand marketing this is for the brand I'm going out there and I'm I'm presenting this I'm going to this trade show because I want to build my brand that's why for us the absolute focus is definitely on tandem and if we do create new products it's to support say I can't relate to the product at all for two reasons one I'm a bther and I love high pressure and I'm concerned about you cutting the pressure in half secondly I couldn't imagine getting into a shower with my husband Bill getting naked it would be my idea of the worst nightmare on his side and on mine forget it you have a a younger demographic I'm out Brad I Jeff you guys have built a great business I bought a super fancy house with 10 shower heads and consistently I use one I'm not the person who would buy this I think it's hard for me to get there I'm out I wish you all the best guys I think it's a great product I think this is going to be a cash generating machine and the biggest mistake you can make would be to try to grow too fast take the money people are throwing at you but that's not conducive to an investor because if it's 400,000 for 10% you have to generate $4 million in after tax profits for me to get my money back I don't see it as an investable business I see it as an amazing business for you guys but for those Reasons I'm out I think you guys are amazing but I'm not connecting with the product as something for me to invest in I'm sorry I'm out I it I'm going to make you two offers you can choose between the two of them number one I'll do the $400,000 with a royalty per unit of $40 I would stop the royalty after I get 1.2 million back and I'll take the 10% Equity in case we sell it or I give you the $400,000 and I'm the third partner 33 and 13% and every dollar that comes out I'm getting 33 A3 Cent you're going to rush to do those deals you can decide because that's what I that's what I think it's worth or or you can go have a shower how about 20% for $600,000 no 20% the the compan $600,000 the funny thing is you you don't need 400,000 why would you do that to make it more he he gets more equity in the company no I know why you would do it to try to entice it why would you need to do that that's the only red flag that I've seen why would you give up 20% of your company even for $600,000 if you do 5 million next year you're making million Millions yeah millions of dollars and you're giving up a fifth of that you're guys you have an offer on the table what do you want to do what do you want to are you willing to negotiate on your offer I haven't heard anything I've heard squawking all I hear is squawking the only offer you have is me what you allow to come back in remember that go back in I'm still curious why would you give up 20% of your company for $600,000 when you're anticipating doing how much in sales this year we definitely think that it's going to be a discount on on what we're worth and what we've built here and demonstrated but for us this is a it's a it's a costly business how much cash do you have in the bank 250,000 for us it's having a resource that can help plus even strategize between different cash is an issue you may be profitable but because you're growing which got back to my point which is why I asked the question on profitability versus let's go go go go yeah we that's exactly what we want to do I'm out thank you you got to make a decision you can't do it that tells me you're not sharp you weren't going to do that deal that's I don't know but we don't have to worry about it see you later anyone else want to come back in no but guys Chase cash not sales you came to the Vice tank good luck guys thank you all much bye for us it wind up out as as we could have hoped we would have loved to have gotten a deal but I think their logic makes sense and I'm excited to continue building this business exactly as per their advice they had no ability to focus on the only offer they had you got to realize you have a real offer you got to focus on it I got bored e\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** second, first, third (ORDINAL), minutes (TIME)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the pressure, a brand, you guys, a partner, one

Sharks, mushrooms have been blowing up in popularity. They're a culinary delicacy. They offer incredible health and cognitive benefits. But these mushrooms are hard to find at most grocery stores, and growing them yourself can be even harder. That's exactly why we created Terishroom. Terasum is a fully automated mushroom growth computer that helps anyone, anywhere grow lab quality mushrooms with zero experience from the comfort and safety from your own home. You turn it on, you fill up the water tank, you then place the ready torow mushroom block inside the terishroom, you select the mushroom you want to grow in the app, and that's it. You have mushrooms growing. And this is a product that makes it simple and affordable for everyone. , , sharks, we would love for you to join us and build something magical with us. Thank you. It's cool. They look flowers. Jared, do you provide the mushroom with a the the grow chamber, the grow computer? Yes. , happy to talk about the business model quick. , , we have a printer and ink cartridge business model, ? , we sell the grow chamber for $3.99 and then on the back end, we have a subscription where we sell these ready torow mushroom cakes for 30 bucks a piece. How much does this cost you to make? $158. 158. That's . And then what does a shroom block cost? 351. This is where we make a lot of cash. How long does it take for a girl block to become that a fruing body? It depends on what you're growing. Some varieties such as oysters can grow in as little as 7 days. Some reishi can take longer up to 6 weeks. a lot of people they love them because they view it as a functional art piece. , with the mood lighting, the embedded time-lapse camera. This is something that they show off to their friends on social media and it's it's a brag point. You're a mushroomologist. Micologist. Yes. A micologist. You're a pretty bright guy. You can tell. Where did this come from? Yeah. , it started about 7 years ago. I was in college. I was growing mushrooms in my dorm. Of course you were. Of course I was. , and it it was something that I had a natural interest in and I decided I want to get into product building. , I bought some 3D printers, figured out CAD modeling, basic micro electronics. And it started off as a weekend hackathon project and there was a lot of interest. And where we're at now is we have 6,500 paid customers, 22 6,500. Yes. And 22,500 people on the email wait list. I got back from Shanghai last week. We're rolling out mass production. 22,000 back orders. 22,000 people on the email wait list. Weight list. What does that mean? What does that mean? They they signed up to get a small discount. Can you walk us through your sales history? Yeah. Terishroom started back in August 2022. I started running ads on Facebook and since then we've generated $780,000 in revenue total. Total. Yeah. But keep in mind we haven't shipped out yet. Yeah. And Wait, wait, wait, wait. You haven't shipped any yet? I got back from Shanghai. you said you sold 6,500 units pre-sale. I'm sorry. Pre-sales. No, you didn't say that. , I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. You've taken 78,000 of pre-orders in two years and not shipped a single product. I think I should I should keep selling it without shipping stuff. , that's not horrible if they deliver. It's only horrible if they don't deliver. Two years, Mark. No, they haven't. We collect the money for 2 years. Yeah, he has. No, no. Here, let me clarify this. , we started Facebook ads in Q4 2022. We shut them off because what happened was I had a a prototype. I was told by a product development company that was , yeah, we can get this done in a couple months. I was , Sweet, we're almost there. I realized that was not the truth. it was back to the draw and even make a mold in a couple of months. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. what happened is I was , I need to build a team that is on the cap table and we are all in this and not someone who's going to charge a per hour or a consultancy fee. But that was 2 years ago. Why haven't you shipped 50 of them or some element of , , , frankly, , we've we've overengineered this. We we didn't want to ship out hundreds and get a refund problem. When are you going to ship your first,000 units and have them in the market? , we're going to have 1,140 units shipped to our Austin warehouse by July, Jared, but I think it's cool, ? And if it turns out to work, it could be nice, but you oversell. You're not there and ready to deliver yet. And that's a whole different level of uncertainty and and terror. I can see it being great for you. , I'm excited for you. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Jared. But I think it's beautiful. I think it's exciting, but I think your valuation is way, way, way off. And for that reason, I'm out. Understood. Thank you. Wish you the best. It's a beautifully designed product. You're a highly credible guy. But we had to ask you if you shipped any. You didn't tell us that. It always makes me nervous when I have to find out such a crucial fact and pull it out. I can't get there. I'm out. Thank you. I love hydroponic farming. I think it's cool. There's no pesticides. Exactly. It's safer. But this seems to me overengineered. If it was simply something where you watered it, it could grow. It's got the light. Without the camera, without the app, it would be a much simpler contraption. , I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Neighbor. , all fungi lead back to Mr. Wonderful. I the idea. I I'm willing to take a flyer on it, but not at your valuation. I'll give you the 175. I go on the ride for 15%. Are you ready? honestly, I don't think you're ready to take on an investor. , he can make a decision. Are you going to walk out of here without a deal or I become an investor and I put my team on it and we get you more orders than you've ever dreamt of? Why do you think 15%. It's my intuition after doing deals for decades. If this works, we're going to have to raise a lot more money for inventory alone, ? And I'm willing to take that risk, but it's embedded in the valuation. Kevin, , respectfully, we we raised a lot more money at a much higher valuation. , I I totally respect that, but they are not me. I don't think you're ready to put the product out on the market. Even if you're about He has no choice but to put it on the market. No, he does have a choice cuz he has a brand that he doesn't want to destroy. He doesn't have a brand yet. He hasn't shipped a unit yet. He's got,40 coming that he's already spent the money on the thing that a person can do ever. No, you don't got it because you're going to invest in it and you don't even I'm willing to take that chance. I already talked about it. I'm going to be honest with you. The biggest problem that a person making a product can do is putting it out on the market when it is not ready. That is true. It can destroy you, your credibility, all the people that were behind you. And Jared, I'm willing to take that chance and then get back. Lori, we got it. I'm willing to take that chance and invest in you. 175,000 for 15%. I'll do that deal. I have no flexibility. What do you want to do? That is a That is a number that it's absolutely not going to work. Kevin, I could do 5%. And let me tell you why. Because , you don't have to go any further. I'm out. Thank you, Jared. Thank you.

in the US I have six P utility or design utility I have six pending worldwide this is great but do you have any sales I I do have sales I have a a cumulative 283,000 in sales I launch I hate that don't ever tell me cumulative for how many years that's 2016 17 and 18 what were sales last year 198,000 all online and why does it cost you to make a unit the handle itself manufactured overseas is $431 with packaging duties and landed I'm at $592 give me excited about the retailers you've talked to that want to bring it in and test it do you have a Target or Walmart that wants to put it in the

it's personal personal Capital my yes it is personal isn't it yeah what what did all that money go into tooling manufacturing patents look Nathan I think it's a good idea but your challenge is you

out Robert are you buying two of these no I'll tell you why I'm not buying the product and I'll demonstrate something for you Nathan I went to the doctor with the twins the first time and I was swinging the babies around and doing it all badly and the doctor looked at me and said you haven't done this for a while have you he goes let me show you an easier way to do it do that carry it around this that's better you could do this a lot longer than you can do this but you could do that a lot longer than you could do the twist I tell you you're a great salesman but let me tell you what is of great concern to me it's your judgment the idea that you could spend $750,000 developing this product is mindboggling to me you went and got all these patents before you had sales what could other the patents if you don't have the sales as much as I you I'm out look does anybody want this product the patents intrigue me the revenues don't I'm out thank you Nathan first of all I loved your super hop model and the two babies love that I admire how you got to Market I completely disagree with Kevin if you can get 200,000 in sales in 2 years on a $30 product that's a lot of volume unit I applaud you for that thank you and still you won't buy it I accept people are buying it but I'm carrying around baby seats all the time I don't carry them long enough where I would think I would need this if I'm

And we're best friends, cocktail lovers, and the busy bees behind Barb's Bartending. We've created a unique way for you to celebrate and learn to make cocktails from your own space. Barbies is a mobile cocktail class company shaking up memorable experiences for friends, family, and anyone feeling the buzz. When you book a Barbie mobile cocktail class, an instructor shows up at your space to lead a class full of cocktail shaking and spirited conversation. You provide the liquor and the location, and we provide the rest. , all you do is show up and be your own mixologist. In a Barbie class, an instructor guides you through making delicious cocktails. Whether you want to stir things up at your bachelorette party, corporate team building, or birthday celebration, a Barbie's cocktail class provides a fresh way to celebrate and connect together. , Sharks, we're seeking $75,000 for 10% equity to join the Barbies Hive. , take a shot on us and get buzzed with Barbies. Sharks, in front of you is our most popular two Barbies cocktails, the Rosemary Honey Paloma and Strawberry Old-Fashioned. Let's drink up. We'll join you. [Applause] that. Cheers, Sharks. Cheers. tasty. In the new world we're living where everybody's working hybrid or offline there is a need for community in corporations a lot of people are feeling lonely. There is a need for us to connect. , we feel that need for sure. we launched in 2019 as an event bartending company. Precoid in Nashville, Tennessee. We were slinging drinks at large scale events, weddings, things that. Are we both bartenderes? We are. Yes. We used to be us and now we have a team of 25. Tell us about your background. We met at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. And we started Barbies while I was still in school. I got a call one day from Willow and she said, Hey, do you want to go to bartending school on a complete whim? , what are your sales? , in 2019, we grossed $19,000. Got it. In 2020, when we transitioned to virtual classes, we were still able to almost double our revenue and hit 38,000. Got it. In 2021, as we came out of the pandemic, we transitioned those virtual classes into in-person classes, and we nearly doubled again at 76,000. And last year, we expanded to four new cities, and we grossed under $190,000. Good for you. Good for you. What's going to happen this year? This year, we are expected to gross $400,000. We We have expanded to four brand new cities. , now we are in seven cities. People are not too busy for connection and specifically bachelorettes and corporate groups which are our top two demographics. They eat this up over and over again. We do 52% of our business in the bachelorette scene and 26% is corporate. What do you need from a shark? what we need from a shark is help with expansion. We know that as a service our number one strategic advantage is taking up the market. There's no one doing what we do in as many places as we do it and we want to make sure it stays that way. , we want to spend $20,000 on an automated booking platform. We want to automate everything. Secondly, we want to spend $20,000 on enhanced onboarding. We need to be able to bring people on quickly and efficiently. And , that means branding our bartend. Our cocktail class instructors. And then lastly, we want to spend the remainder of of your money on expanding your money, which takes approximately $5,000 for each city in the first six months. , look, what you're doing is great. And obviously you both are entrepreneurs. I'll give you the snaps, ? done. The challenge for me is that opening up a city now helps you grow. But once you get to all the cities you want to go to, growing from there gets hard and expensive. And I think that puts a lid on your business in terms of what I need to see in terms of scale. I'm out. I love what you're doing, but I don't want to be in the service industry. , , good luck. I'm out. Thank you. Here's where I'm at with it. I think you guys are the real deal. Thank you. I sell a lot of wine. Millions and millions and millions of bottles of wine. If this was more of a wine play, I think I'd be all over it. But this would be against the energy I put into supporting LI Fine Wines. I I wish you the best. I'm out. Listen guys, what you're doing. I think it'd be fun to work with you guys. We built a film marketing team across the country with kind and we had to build all of the systems to be able to create calendars, to create tracking, to create a resource book. , we've done a lot of that. I don't think you came with a crazy number, but I I would do this for 20%. 20%. Yeah. I love you guys and I think what you're doing is phenomenal. I think he gave you a fantastic offer, better than what I would have and I think he's the partner for you. I'm out. I am getting a little bit worried for Daniel. Now you're the only person and everybody said that it was a good deal. Daniel, I your offer is wonderful. , you should say yes. We're honored. Would you do 15? No, but if we take longer, it might go to 25%. Would you do 20% for for $75,000? Is there any wiggle room here? I am I am thinking my kids earned the to get a pet and I will advocate for us to name their pet Barbie. That's weird. Upgrade. my god. That is your upgrade. You're about to lose this thing. , you got the drink. Good job. Good job. Thank you much. Thank you for caring about this the way we care about it. Great job. Congratulations, guys. I think this is a testament to us saying yes to things. I hope that entrepreneurs out there are watching this saying, \"I can say yes, too. I can jump in. I can try it.\" It might be ramshackle at first, but that's . We all start that way. try it. Say yes. Find a good partner that you trust with your whole heart. And it's going to be such a beautiful journey.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 10%, 52%, 26%, 20%, 25% (PERCENT), Strawberry Old-Fashioned, Belmont University (ORG), Nashville, Tennessee (GPE), Secondly, first (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** a lot, you guys, an instructor, a need, a shark, your money, good job, the tank\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 create: way\n  \u2022 provide: liquor\n  \u2022 guide: you\n  \u2022 provide: way\n  \u2022 seek: 75,000\n  \u2022 take: shot\n  \u2022 join: you\n  \u2022 be: need\n  \u2022 feel: need\n  \u2022 sling: drinks\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.30)\n\n**Topics:** cocktail, class, way, thing, barbie",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] First into the tank are entrepreneurs who believe they have an important postworkout tool. Hi Sharks. My name is Anthony Jensenstead and I'm Lauren Campbell. We're seeking $500,000 for 2 and a.5% of our company Firefly Recovery. Sharks, did many athletes today recovery has become as important as working out? Athletes are talking about their recovery. They're tracking their recovery. They're even posting about it on social media. But recovery modalities have not kept up with the times. We see products these pneumatic compression boots, but they're clunky, time consuming, and they do not fit into the active lifestyle of today's athletes. But now athletes have a better, easier, portable, mobile recovery solution, Firefly Recovery. Why don't we invite one of our loyal customers, five-time Olympian Carrie Walsh Jennings, to join us and talk about how Firefly has helped her and show you how it works. Hey, Sharks. Hey. Hey. Hey. How are you guys? Great. We're good. What an honor. You guys are crushing it. As you can see, the Firefly gently stimulates the paranal nerve in the leg to cause the foot to flutter. We call that the Firefly flutter. This flutter action acts as a natural pump to increase systemic blood flow, speed up recovery times while reducing soreness. We move three times more blood flow than compression. Sharks 800 pro and college teams are already purchasing the Firefly. , who wants to set the athletic recovery market on fire and join us on team firefly? , where is the injury per se on Carrie? Yeah. No injury at all. We're talking about recovery. , you work out, these athletes are training hard for their events and then after that they want to recover faster they can perform better the next day. , we used to think of recovery as a day that you take off, but recovery is a lifestyle. You want to eat better, you want to sleep better, all those things. But a big component of recovery is circulation. Anthony, can you pull those compression legs out? Yes. , I'm a huge investor in TheraBody. They're a percussion recovery company that has massage guns. , I feel you're talking to me now with those compression legs and I wear them because I'm getting older. Are you saying that this device replaces the need to wear those compression legs, which I have to sit on the chair, prop my legs up, my kids think I'm an alien because my legs get swelled up and they come down. I can put that on my leg and walk around and assume life is normal and I don't have to wear that. Absolutely. Lord have mercy. Can we get a world-class athlete to also tell us from her user side? Yeah. , I have been a pro alete for over 20 years. I retired, which still hurts my heart to say out loud. , but when I'm training and trying to be best in the world and win gold medals, I would use them and I would notice my legs are lighter. I'm fresher. Is this only for legs? It's a great question. , 70% of our blood is in our lower extremities, ? All we're doing is using your nervous system to pump it back to your heart faster. , it's a systemic flush. It's called on pulse technology. That's the nerve stimulation. Do you have a patent for this? , nine families of patents, 47 patents in total. They are utility patents and it this product is patent protected. All guys, let's talk about the big shakaroo in the room. Two and a half% for 500,000 is a 20 million valuation. Why in the world do you think you are worth $20 million? Because I love to shred around valuation and I'm getting the weasel out in me. Lifetime sales we're at 7.5 million. It's not going to do it. The last 12 months were 4 million. We are on track this year to do 5 1.5 million. We are growing at a fast rate. The first few years of the technology was focused on teams. We didn't have a direct to consumer business. One quick question about the product. Speaking of the consumer, we're over the product. Merit. No, I'm over you. I want to talk about valuation because it's the big shakaroo in the room. You are not worth $20 million. food. Listen, 25 years ago when I started in the investment space at Goldman Sachs, this is the first thing they taught me. There's no such thing as a bad deal. It's bad prices. And now, this smells a good deal, but at a bad price. , let me ask you a couple questions. What was the total amount you raised in the past? Cuz I feel you're jacking this valuation because you're trying to appease some old investors. In 2022, we did an athlete seed round. We raised a million dollars with professional athletes and friends and family. That was at a 10 million pre- money valuation. my god. Wow. And that's all you've raised total? That's all we've raised total. How much does it cost you to make it and how much you sell it for? Landed cost is $1,730. Retail. These sell for $48 for one set. And And how long does this last? If you did recovery every single day your athletes, they're going to get a whole month. Don't they get pissed off that you've got to keep on buying again and again and again? They're not unhappy with the product because you're going to get 15 treatments per pack. Guys, I love the product. I you guys. Carrie, congratulations on your success honoring the country this way. I love it all. Evaluation is a real sticking point for me on this one. I don't think you're worth 20. , I wish you the best of luck. I'm out. Thank you. guys, I think I'm a little confused on a lot of the things that was said here. I don't I don't know enough at such a high valuation with where this is now. Too confusing for me. , I'm out. Thank you, Damon. , guys, let me tell you where I'm at. Look, it sounds amazing. Sounds it works. I can see our guys using it, but at its price, $48 a month to get this recovery as opposed to maybe not as good with the leggings is different. We're gonna The idea of spending $48 a month is insane for 99.99%. What would you pay to feel better? No. , seriously, I think you're looking at it wrong. It's $3 a treatment, ? , if I'm training for No, it's not a treatment. Look, it's recovery. Recovery is not a treatment unless you're a professional athlete. No, no, no. If you're training for a marathon, if you're a CrossFit athlete, you got to be rich to do it. Someone who pumps iron. Starbucks is $5 a cup. We're talking $48 a month. That's every subscription you have for every streamer that you have. , that's how people will think about it for those reasons. See, I don't agree with that at all. Thank you, Mark. , I see a real market for it. , and I see it the real market as being direct to consumer. Yes. As people age, if they've been active in seven people are turning 65 every minute in this country. There you go. I think it's a great product and I think there's a lot of promise. Roshan and I were talking. He agrees with me. , we have an offer together. Yeah. , gonna pull a card from from your deck here. I I never thought I would do it, man. Every time I hear your deals. Don't go there. Three sharks are out, but Lori and Rashawn are interested in Anony's and Lauren's workout recovery product, Firefly. , we'll offer you the $500,000 for 5%. We want a $1.50 50 cent royalty until we get our money back and then 50 cent in perpetuity thereafter and we will make sure you guys take this to the next level. You are wise grasshopper. Yes. in terms of the royalty offer, first of all, we appreciate your offer. we are already investing much back into the business. We were not looking to add a royalty to the business now because we want to be able to continue to invest and grow in the business. , what's your counter? Yes, we would come up from the 2 1/2% to 3 1/2% for the 500,000. Come on. In perpetuity royalty, you have a problem with we Yeah, that always is an issue. 50 cents is not going to ruin your business. 50 cents could ruin your business. , they made a counter, guys. What are you going to do? , look, first I think your last round with the athletes was mispriced. If the issue is the actual royalty, we can talk about that. Our concern is that we never get our money back. You guys never sell this business. But you're a VC, Rashan. I know. I need my money on exits and selling the company. Can I talk about the valuation? Prior to coming in here, we did have informal conversations with PE and venture. And for this category, they were saying four to six times rev is a good I'll say it for him. We don't care. We're sharks. , we did come in below that because you are sharks. I don't want to negotiate against ourselves. We countered there. It's only one thing that you're not anticipating. You're going to take millions of dollars and spend it on marketing and you're going to get a million dollars of marketing from us for free. I have a separate marketing agent that I would charge him an average of 3 million a year for this. far, our final offer is 500. I think we should do this. , we'll count on your offer. , if we remove the royalty, we need our 5%. , no royalty, 5% for $500,000. Our is our counter and final offer. Pretty clean deal. That should be easy. Yes. You guys appreciate that is clean. , coming in here, we obviously did have our top level point we could go to and we felt that was 4%. That would be unfortunate. You're going to let 100 basis points and you're going to walk out without a deal. 1% you're going to let quit the deal. that's crazy. Any investor in the country would tell you don't be delusion sensitive. to be success sensitive. And now that 100 basis points could cost you guys hundreds of millions of dollars. I see hundreds if not thousands of pitches. It's impossible to get where you are. And you're going to walk out for 100 basis points, 1%. You're nuts. You're absolutely nuts if you do that. You are. What do you guys want to do? We're going to take a moment. Thank you. What's that evaluation? , , we had a game plan when we came in and Tyson said, , everybody's got a plan until somebody punches you in the face. We appreciate the punch and we would love to take the deal with you guys. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Gives me chills. nice meeting you. I'm sorry for that. That was one of the scariest things I've ever done in my life. Congrats, guys. done. my gosh. We did it. Back to the grind. Honestly, we've been grinding since we started. It's not going to change. It's going to add more fuel to the fire. And I'm sure they're going to be great at, , opening our eyes up to how to run this business differently and and better\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** First, first (ORDINAL), Firefly Recovery, Firefly (WORK_OF_ART), Firefly Recovery, Goldman Sachs, Starbucks, Anony, PE (ORG), Olympian (NORP), Firefly (PRODUCT), TheraBody, VC (GPE), 65 every minute (TIME), Rashan (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, the product, the firefly, those compression legs, my legs, the business, 100 basis points, their recovery\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 seek: 500,000\n  \u2022 do: athletes\n  \u2022 track: recovery\n  \u2022 see: products\n  \u2022 have: recovery solution\n  \u2022 invite: one\n  \u2022 crush: it\n  \u2022 stimulate: paranal nerve\n  \u2022 flutter: acts\n  \u2022 move: blood flow\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.16)\n\n**Topics:** recovery, guy, athlete, leg, firefly",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi, Sharks. I'm Lisa. And I'm Jake. We're from New Jersey and we're seeking $343,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Let's face it, cleaning your shower is about as much fun as getting a root canal. It's no wonder my son Jake here survived four full years of college without ever cleaning his shower once. Mom. He even had a stinky pet that he never bathed. Using a bucket to bathe Joey was setting off a water bomb in the bathroom. There's got to be a better way. The struggle is real, but have no fear. Rinseroo has come to the rescue. Rinseroos are slip-on hoses that make your least favorite rinsing and bathing chores a breeze. No more buckets. No more backachches. Sharks, you're about to witness rinsing reinvented. You whip out your rinseroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, slip it over any water source, and bam, you're ready to conquer any rinsing challenge that comes your way. And the best news, rinseroos work on water sources all around your house, sinks, shower heads, and tub faucets. This one even has a spray head. make sure your connection is tight and get rinserooing. Mom, mom, there are many things you can do with a rinseroo. Rinse dirty boots. Bathe the baby. Not the baby. Not it from the sink. But wait, there's more. Use it as a bet. Don't forget to give grandpa his sponge bath. Which one of you sharks hates cleaning as much as we do and wants to clean up with us at the bank instead with Rineroo? Tell me how you came up with this idea. , here's the thing. how they say sometimes your best ideas happen in the shower? That's where this idea came to me. , we have a beach house at the Jersey Shore, and when we're all there, there's 15 of us and four dogs. I wanted to be up on the beach, but instead, I found myself in the shower cleaning dogs, cleaning the shower walls. I was filling a bucket over and over. I'm , there's got to be a better way. , I recruited Jake. Yep. And together, we came up with amazing prototype, and it , worked. , Lori, guess what we did? We bought your book that told us how to figure out if we have a hero or a zero, ? Yeah. And honestly, we're reading the book. I'm , \" my god, we have a hero. We have a hero.\" It's mass market. It's demonstrable and it's solved many problems. , your stuff. I love it. It is, Lori. And I have to say, I'm grateful because your advice has changed our lives for the better. Now, Lisa, here's the moment of truth. Because in Lor's book it says I sit beside Mr. Wonderful and always asks this nasty question about valuation. You're putting this business out at $6.8 million. Absolutely. Why is Rinseroo worth anywhere near $6 million? what, Mr. Wonderful? I know that's page three in Lor's book. Exactly. I crunched the numbers and let's hear the numbers. Let's hear the numbers. now here's the thing. We started in March of 2019. Yeah. And instantly Rinseroo was a success. Within a couple months, we were profitable. We did over a million dollars in sales our first year. Since then, I might have to get Lor's book. That's . We've had double and tripledigit sales. What are you going to make this year? What are you going to make? Close to $5 million. Where are you selling this? , now we're only selling online. We're 99% online. That's why you need a shark. That's amazing. What do you sell them for and what does it cost you to make? Our landed cost, depending on what product you have, is anywhere from $2.50 to $4.50. And our retail prices are anywhere from $15.95 to $29.95. , we've got an 85% profit margin. You guys got to be the two of you. the two of you running the business. I love this mother son thing much. I honestly what a dream. . , guys, you must know what it cost to acquire a customer, ? The customer acquisition cost. I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wonderful. Yes. $2.50. And what is your rorowass if you're spending money on? . We have a 10 to one return on our ad spend on Amazon. What percentage of your revenues do you spend on Amazon? 10%. , what are you making in net cash profits? Almost a million dollars. That doesn't suck. How many knockoffs do you have now? We have many knockoffs, but we have a protection service that takes them all down. , we have many knockoffs. Wait, is there a patent? Yes. All . , listen. I'll give you 3.43 for 20%. 20%. I was going to do that same deal for 15. I'd offer you 15. Here's the thing. , I I I don't want to give away a ton of equity, but I would love to work with a shark that can help us grow. , this is for my son, and I I don't I don't want to give away a lot of equity. We've done all the hard work. All . 15%. You have two offers of 15. Unless you want to put a royalty in place, take less equity. What would you What would you suggest? You have you have enough margin. I I think what I would do is I'd do your 5% deal if I got 250 a unit until I made back a million bucks and the royalty goes away forever. , that that's a little hefty, I think. Still, I don't know. , I don't do this often. As a matter of fact, I didn't do it at all at all last year. Not to my little golden friend. I was hoping we would get the gold ticket. my goodness. I think you deserve my golden ticket. Thank you much. I do. Wow. You read my book. We did. From cover to cover. You followed it. You did what it said. It helped you. You are my perfect entrepreneurs. You are successful. [Music] What that means is that I'm giving you exactly what you're asking. Thank you much. Wow. my god. Yeah. Welcome to the Rinser family. Necklace. The golden ticket. , last year nobody got a golden ticket. That's incredible. I hate to admit it, but you were our girl from day one. Thank you much. You are You are our dream shark. Congratulations. I love you guys. I love you guys. Congratulations. my god, Jake. I'm excited. It's an inventor's dream to have gotten the golden ticket from Lorie.

I'm seeking $175,000 in exchange for 2 and a half% equity in my company. sharks, mushrooms have been blowing up in popularity. They're a culinary delicacy. They offer incredible health and cognitive benefits. But these mushrooms are hard to find at most grocery stores. And growing them yourself can be even harder. That's exactly why we created Terishroom. Terishroom is a fully automated mushroom growth computer that helps anyone anywhere grow lab quality mushrooms with zero experience from the comfort and safety from your own home. You turn it on. You fill up the water tank. You then place the ready to grow mushroom block inside the terishroom. You select the mushroom you want to grow in the app. And that's it. You have mushrooms growing. And this is a product that makes it simple and affordable for everyone. , , Sharks, we would love for you to join us and build something magical with us. Thank you. It's cool. They look flowers. Jared, do you provide the mushroom with a the the grow chamber, the grow computer? Yes. , happy to talk about the business model quick. , , we have a printer and ink cartridge business model. . , we sell the grow chamber for $3.99 and then on the back end we have a subscription where we sell these ready torow mushroom cakes for 30 bucks a piece. How much does this cost you to make? $158. $158. That's . And then what does a shroom block cost? 351. This is where we make a lot of cash. How long does it take for a grow block to become that a fruing bite? It depends on what you're growing. Some varieties such as oysters can grow in as little as seven days. Some reishi can take longer up to 6 weeks. a lot of people they love them because they view it as a functional art piece. with the mood lighting, the embedded time-lapse camera. This is something that they show off to their friends on social media and it's it's a brag point. You're a mushroomologist. Micologist. Yes. A micologist. Yes. You're a pretty bright guy. You can tell. Where did this come from? Yeah. , it started about seven years ago. I was in college. I was growing mushrooms in my dorm. Of course you were. Of course I was. , and it it was something that I had a natural interest in and I decided I want to get into product building. , I bought some 3D printers, figured out CAD modeling, basic micro electronics, and it started off as a weekend hackathon project and there was a lot of interest. And , , where we're at now is we have 6,500 paid customers, 22 6,500. Yes. and 22,500 people on the email wait list. I got back from Shanghai last week. We're rolling out mass production. 22,000 back orders. 22,000 people on the email wait list. Weight list. What does that mean? What does that mean? They they signed up to get a small discount. Can you walk us through your sales history? Yeah, Terishroom started back in August 2022. I started running ads on Facebook and since then we've generated $780,000 in revenue total. Total. Yeah, but keep in mind we haven't shipped out yet. Yeah. And we , wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You haven't shipped any yet? I got back from Shanghai. , because you said you sold 6,500 units, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. , you didn't say that. , I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Pre-sales. You've taken 78,000 of pre-orders in two years and not shipped the single product. , I think I should I should keep selling it without shipping stuff. That's not horrible if they deliver. It's only horrible if they don't deliver. It's been two years, Mark. No, they haven't collect the money for 2 years. Yeah, he has. No, no. Here, let me clarify this. , we started Facebook ads in Q4 2022. We shut them off because what happened was I had a a prototype. I was told by a product development company that was , yeah, we can get this done in a couple months. , I was , sweet, we're almost there. I realized that was not the truth. , it was back to the draw. Can't even make a mold in a couple of months. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. what happened is I was I need to build a team that is on the cap table and we are all in this and not someone who's going to charge a per hour or a consultancy fee. But that was 2 years ago. Why haven't you shipped 50 of them or some element of , frankly we've we've overengineered this. We we didn't want to ship out hundreds and get a refund problem. When are you going to ship your first,000 units and have them in the market? , we're gonna have 1,140 units shipped to our Austin warehouse by July. Jared, but I think it's cool, ? And if it turns out to work, it could be nice, but you oversell. You're not there and ready to deliver yet. And that's a whole different level of uncertainty and and terror. I can see it being great for you, I'm excited for you. But for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Jared. But I think it's beautiful. I think it's exciting. But I think your valuation is way way way off. And for that reason, I'm out. You're s Thank you. Wish you the best. It's a beautifully designed product. You're a highly credible guy. But we had to ask you if you've shipped any. You didn't tell us that. It always makes me nervous when I have to find out such a crucial fact and pull it out. I can't get there. I'm out. Thank you. I love hydroponic farming. I think it's cool. , there's no pesticides. Exactly. It's safer. But this seems to me overengineered. If it was simply something where you watered it, it could grow. It's got the light without the camera, without the app, it would be a much simpler contraption. , I wish you good luck, but I'm out. Thank you, Lord. , all fun lead back to Mr. Wonderful. I the idea. I I'm willing to take a flyer on it, but not at your valuation. I'll give you the 175. I go on the ride for 15%. Are you ready? honestly, I don't think you're ready to take on an investor. , he can make a decision. Are you going to walk out of here without a deal or I become an investor and I put my team on it and we get you more orders than you've ever dreamt of? Why do you think 15%. It's my intuition after doing deals for decades. if this works, we're gonna have to raise a lot more money for inventory alone, ? And I'm willing to take that risk, but it's embedded in the valuation. Kevin, , respectfully, we we raised a lot more money at a much higher valuation. , I I totally respect that, but they are not me. I don't think you're ready to put the product out on the market, even if you're about to. He has no choice but to put it on the market. No, he does have a choice cuz he has a brand that he doesn't want to destroy. He doesn't have a brand yet. He hasn't shipped the unit yet. He's got,40 coming that he's already spent the money on here that a person can do ever in life. We got it. No, you don't got it because you're going to invest in it and you don't I'm willing to take that chance. I already talked about it. I'm going to be honest with you. The biggest problem that a person making a product can do is putting it out on the market when it is not . That is true. It can destroy you, your credibility, all the people that were behind you. And Jared, I'm willing to take that chance and then get back. Lori, Lori, we got it. I'm willing to take that chance and invest in you. 175,000 for 15%. I'll do that deal. I have no flexibility. What do you want to do? That is a that is a number that it's absolutely not going to work. Kevin, I could do 5%. And let me tell you why. Because you don't have to go any further. I'm out. Thank you, Jared. Thank you'all. Good luck, Jared.

Not if we have anything to say about it. Hey Sharks, my name is Glenn Smith and I'm his daughter and business partner, Madison Smith. And today we are here seeking $90,000 for 15% equity in our company. Sharks, for generations, cooks around the world have sought relief from the infamous onion tears. The burning, the itching, my eyes. Cutting onions is painful. And we have tried all the hacks and none of them have worked for us. We have tried chewing on bread while cutting. We've put a matchick between our teeth. And this guy has even worn yard goggles in the kitchen. And trust us Sharks, none of these hacks have worked for us, which is why we invented the Fion. The Fion is a countertop cute cordless fan that is placed next to your cutting board, which simply blows away the fumes and vapors of eye irritating vegetables such as onions, shallots, peppers, garlic, etc. You'll only cry tears of joy. It is that simple. , come on sharks. Who's ready to chop it up with the fanion? And who's ready to be blown away? Now, sharks, no need to get weepy. You each have a fanion to blow those tears away. , you have an onion, a knife, and a fan to put this to the test. , there's a lever on the back that'll turn it on, and you can get to chopping. And Madison, do most people cry with onions? Yes, we've Yeah. , why would you not? I don't often cry. I don't this doesn't sting me at all. ? I am told that if you wear contacts that can be something that would wear if you wear contacts. If you wear contacts, you're lucky. , a unique attribute about vampires. I'm a vampire. We We don't have to cry about onions. We can cut any vegetable. No problem at all. As long as it's dark outside. Is this your full-time jobs? And And also, please tell us about you. You go ahead. I I am a vice president of a large US poultry company. I buy feed ingredients, feed chickens. And Madison, what do you do? After graduating from Georgia Tech, I studied industrial engineering and I've worked in the technology and supply chain spaces for about the last four years. , this simple product, I get it. How much to buy it? We sell them for $19.99 on our website. And what does it cost you to make them? 809. , your numbers. How many do you sell? We launched in November and about seven months. We have sold almost 1,800. We have 28,000 in sales. That's not bad. Not bad at all. How are you guys promoting it? We've predominantly done social media. We've put a lot of money into running ads. And how much money have you spent on advertising far? On advertising about $178,000. And how much money have you invested to get it to this? $468,000. Hello. That's a lot of crying over on you. Where did you get the money to spend 468,000? Cash, credit, home equity. Home equity, too. Home equity as . Correct. Wa. But what did you spend that on for this? , mostly inventory. How much do you have in inventory? At your cost. How much do you have in inventory at your cost? 31,000 units. . , that's 240 250 grand . Correct. You got 31,000 units. What is it costing you to acquire a customer now? Do how much did you spend on advertising divided by the number of units you've sold? 17,000 divided by almost 1,800. Yeah. . about 10 bucks a unit. Yeah. you're breaking even you're not making any money now. You're you're losing some. Yes. What's the plan to sell the existing sunk inventory? That is why we are here is that we need help with that where we started trying to go 100% direct to consumer. Over 10,000 Google searches happen every month of people searching how to stop crying while cutting onions. there's viral Tik Tok videos. This is definitely and it works. We know that it works and there's not a product out there it. And everybody loves a kitchen gadget. maybe there's a reason why there's not a product out there it. Look guys, I give you a lot of credit for diving in and going for it. But this is too niche a market, ? Because when you limit it to onions, that's too small, ? And not a lot of people are going to spend $19.95 to be able to do onions alone. for those reasons, I'm out. Thank you, Bart. Here's the thing. It's something that happens all the time. I watch it with entrepreneurs. You get excited that you don't realize one of the most perilous pitfalls when you first create a product is ordering in too much inventory without sales. You've sold 1,800 in 8 months, give or take. You've sitting on 31,000. This could take you 10 years or more, , to sell it. , what I think you should do, a suggestion is sell it to someone at your cost to break even, but to get money back because you don't want to sit on that big of an expense. It's not a journey that I want to take cuz I know it's a rough road. , but I wish you good luck. I hope you try that. I'm sorry. carry them out. You got a bunch of money tied up in inventory here, 250 grand. , if you sold these things at $9.99, you'd get half your money back. And you say the other was a lesson in life. 31,000 units. that's worth crying about, not the onion. I can't help you because I can't help you. I'm out. All my friends have never started a business. They think the starting a business is standing on the edge of a cliff, ordering 30,000 units, and jumping into the water. Great entrepreneurs learn about controlled risk. You never want to make a mistake that's going to kill you. It's hard to come back from the dead. Kevin's done it, but way it works. You made a big risk and now you're stuck with it. But you got to get rid of that inventory. There is no we're going to grow our market. We're going to sell it here. Get rid of the inventory that you have even at a loss. Even if you get 50 cents on the dollar. I disagree. They're being melodramatic. No, they got rid of dramatic. They took a line of credit on their house to get here. Welcome to the Onion Advice Bank. It's not for me cuz it's not investable. I hope you get some of that cash back. I'm out. Glenn and Madison, I love the fact that you're working together. My daughter's here watching Shark Tank today and it's such a special thing. It's the most important thing in the world because my dad is no longer here with me and I wish he was around and I miss him and I love the fact that you guys can have this journey together. I wish you the best of luck but I'm out. Thank you much much meeting you all. Good luck guys. I hope you make it. Good luck.

We're from New Jersey and we're seeking $343,000 in exchange for 5% of our company. Let's face it, cleaning your shower is about as much fun as getting a root canal. It's no wonder my son Jake here survived four full years of college without ever cleaning his shower once. Mom, he even had a stinky pet that he never bathed. Using a bucket to bathe Joey was setting off a water bomb in the bathroom. There's got to be a better way. The struggle is real, but have no fear. Rinseroo has come to the rescue. Rinseroos are slip-on hoses that make your least favorite rinsing and bathing chores a breeze. No more buckets. No more backachches, sharks. You're about to witness rinsing reinvented. You whip out your rinseroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Slip it over any water source and bam, you're ready to conquer any rinsing challenge that comes your way. And the best news, rinseroos work on water sources all around your house. Sinks, showerheads, and tub faucets. This one even has a spray head. make sure your connection is tight and get rinserooing. Mom. Mom. There are many things you can do with a rinseroo. Rinse dirty boots. Bathe the baby. Not the ba. Not the baby. From the sink. But wait, there's more. Use it as a bedet. Don't forget to give grandpa his sponge bath. Which one of you sharks hates cleaning as much as we do and wants to clean up with us at the bank instead with Rineroo? Tell me how you came up with this idea. , here's the thing. how they say sometimes your best ideas happen in the shower? That's where this idea came to me. , we have a beach house at the Jersey Shore and when we're all there, there's 15 of us and four dogs. I wanted to be up on the beach, but instead I found myself in the shower cleaning dogs, cleaning the shower walls. I was filling a bucket over and over. I'm , there's got to be a better way. , I recruited Jake. Yep. And together we came up with amazing prototype and it worked. Lori, guess what we did? We bought your book that told us how to figure out if we have a hero or a zero. . And honestly, we're reading the book. I'm , \" my god, we have a hero. We have a hero. It's mass market. It's demonstrable. And it solves many problems.\" your stuff. I love it. It It is, Lori. And I have to say I'm grateful because your advice has changed our lives for the better. Now Lisa, here's the moment of truth because in Lor's book it says I sit beside Mr. Wonderful and always ask this nasty question about valuation. You're putting this business out at $6.8 million. Why is Rinseroo worth anywhere near $6 million? what, Mr. Wonderful? I know that's page three in Lor's book. Exactly. I crunched the numbers and three points. Let's hear the numbers. , let's hear the numbers. now here's the thing. We started in March of 2019. Yeah. And instantly, Rinseroo was a success. Within a couple months, we were profitable. We did over a million dollars in sales. Our first year, since then, I might have to get Lor's book. That's . We've had double and tripledigit sales. What are you going to make this year? What are you going to make? close to $5 million. Where are you selling this? , now we're only selling online. We're 99% online. That's why you need to shop. Wow, that's amazing. What do you sell them for and what's it cost you to make? Our landed cost, depending on what product you have, is anywhere from $2.50 to $4.50. And our retail prices are anywhere from $15.95 to $29.95. , about an 85% profit margin. You guys got to be the two of you. the two of you running the business. love this mother son thing much. Honestly, what a dream. . guys, you must know what it cost to acquire a customer, ? The customer acquisition cost. I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wonderful. Yes. $2.50. And what is your rorowass if you're spending money on . We have a 10 to1 return on our ad spend on Amazon. What percentage of your revenues do you spend on Amazon? 10%. what are you making in net cash profits? Almost a million dollars. . That doesn't suck. How many knockoffs do you have now? We have many knockoffs, but we have a protection service that takes them all down. , we have many. Is there a patent? Yes. All . , listen. I'll give you 343 for 20%. 20%. I was going to do that same deal for 15. I'd offer you 15. Here's the thing. , I I I don't want to give away a ton of equity, but I would love to work with a shark that can help us grow. , this is for my son and I I don't I don't want to give away a lot of equity. We've done all the hard work. All . 15%. You have two offers of 15. Unless you want to put a royalty in place, take less equity. What would you What would you suggest? You have you have enough margin. I I think what I would do is I'd do your 5% deal if I got 250 a unit until I made back a million bucks. Then the royalty goes away forever. Oo. , that that's a little hefty. I think still I don't know. , I don't do this often. As a matter of fact, I didn't do it at all last year. Hello to my little golden friend.

total we've rais raised around $290,000 the reason we were able to build this product with such a small investment was because we're experts in software we've worked at Microsoft as developers and Engineers I personally worked in data science this isn't unique and that 3D printers have been out now for a while what's different is is that yours is specifically for toys and is it therefore smaller and less expensive than others out there yeah we sell this printer for $99 which is definitely on the cheapest end of 3D printers what we do specially for kids is we combine hardware and software to make a friendly user experience we have now over 750 toys we add 7 to 10 toys a week and then we're always monitoring what kids are playing with and we adjust what we add based off of that you the worry with toys is that it gets used a couple times and then put away and at 299 that's that's a big decision on a toy what are your sales now we're focusing on internet sales primarily sales on our website we started selling in September we've done over $300,000 in sales since then and all we do is advertise on Facebook and what does it cost you to make we buy this for $150 we sell it for $2.99 but there's nobody on the market that has this software and Hardware stack that's developed for children our biggest Target demographic is 6 to 9 year olds and you can print toys from from famous media Disney Minecraft Marvel Lego also of things youd have to go license those that's licensing is a huge opportunity imagine if a kid could print his own Minecraft world on this printer we see this as a huge huge huge opportunity how long did it take to print this out and how many passes that one takes about 4 hours maybe about eight passes you see there's the problem the attention span of a 6 Seven 8 or 9y- old is going to be difficult and I can see the first couple times mom or dad or whoever helping them and that's great but no kid that age has that attention span and I think that's too big a challenge for those Reasons I'm Alis guys liability wise you're dealing with seven-year-olds when I was seven I would have easily held my my parrot under there to make some boots for the parrot I'm a little afraid of selling to a bunch of six seven and 8y olds where what can happen will go wrong we do require Parental Guidance and you can say that all you want but no parents sitting there for 4 hours with them and that machine's running and I'm is a little concerned about that for that reason I'm out thank you guys you're a subset of the toy business you have to find that parent that's thinking investing $300 in my child's imagination is a good thing and I think that's cool but it's not everybody I it though I'm going to make you an offer I bring a lot of value to this space that's the way I look at it but now you're still at the proof of concept you're starting out and I happen to think licensing would help this and that's hard work I agree I'll give you the 150,000 for 10% and the reason I'm saying that is that certain things you want to do will happen faster with me driving them let me make it easier for you I love the mission I love I have a 9-year-old son I would love the idea that he'd play with this I think at 299 I don't see it yet hope you succeed with it though I I ruin it for you guys but I'm out as a investor I think that Jen and Ben I want you to know something if she drops out that gives me a lot more incentive to get friskier that because you're starting to lose sharks here and I made you an offer I I would I would love to hear your offer Lori before I was rudely inter pointing out a reality of the Shark Tank that's all I was saying I think products this are great because they Inspire kids to build and design and develop the problem I have is is I think that the age group you're targeting is a little bit too young if it was the next age bracket up 8 to 13 I would would it better as an investment for me but because it's not I'm out than she didn't have an offer but you still have an offer but it's going to be modified slightly I'm feeling frisky now I don't it when I make an offer and you're still listening to others you have to realize I have flexibility too I want 15% not 10 as usual all Road lead to Mr Wonderful what are you going to do do you mind if we talk about this for a little bit sure but what happens you don't want to leave the carpet all we'll do $150,000 for 12% that's our final deal you think the difference you think the difference of 3% R basis points makes a difference I you either believe that 15% is worth it or not I bring a lot to the table no 85% of a watermelon is a whole lot better than 100% of a grape all we'll do 13% and then two no no I'm not done and and 2% in advisory share 13% and say it again 2% in our advisory shares from our pool [Music] you have a deal all congratulations my goodness that was tough that's good you did a good job congratulations guys you did it

I'm Brandon Himmel from Leaport, Texas, and I'm seeking an investment of $200,000 for 5% ownership in my company, Roughlin Liners. Wow. millions of dog owners, I love taking my dog Satie with me whenever I go to the beach, hiking, or anything outdoors. But taking Satie with me on adventures would leave my truck with muddy seats, scratched door panels, and endless fur. There was no way to completely protect the backseat area from the mess Satie caused. That's why I invented Rough Liners. Down. Rufflin Liners protects my truck I don't need to worry about the mess Satie causes in the back seat area. The door-to-door protection makes it convenient to take your pet on more adventures and not stress about the mess. The cover velcros to plastic window inserts that easily slide into the window seal the door panels are completely protected. My patent pending design is engineered for the ultimate protection and it's made from heavy duty materials that it lasts. you don't need to worry about the mess your dog causes in the backseat area. With Roughliners, you're covered. Sharks, who's ready to join Roughliners and help pet owners take their best friend on more adventures? Brandon, how much do you sell it for? My prices range from about $99 to $150. I'm a premium product in this category. I try to provide a superior product, not only in the design, but in the materials that we choose. Brandon, you're saying there's competition then for this? There's nothing this extra large. Once my patent got published, I removed all there was 12 competitors and they all got removed. , there are seat liners, ? Yeah. There's a good amount of cheap Chinese manufacturers. , a couple of things that my seat covers have besides the door panel protection is I have e extra anchor points at the bottom that it keeps everything nice and snug and when your dog's in the back seat, it doesn't start to move out of place. I noticed that cuz I have the I've bought the the liners. You throw them in the back seat and they move. Yeah. Within 20 minutes they move and there's hair everywhere. Absolutely. Brenda, do you sell online? Most of my sales are online through Amazon. That's where I originally started. What are your sales? Tada. In 2022 is when I launched the brand of Roughliners. That was December of 2022. 2023 I did $1.25 million in sales. A million of that was in the last quarter. And Brandon, this year, what are you yearto date? This year I've done $3.1 million in sales. Great. Good for you. Thank you much. And what did you make on that? What on the 1.25 million? What did you make last year? About 40,000. Why low? , I've invested a lot into the long-term differentiator of the brand. , that's fine. , I've spent money on patents. , 3.1 million this year to date. How much do you think you'll do fourth quarter? I I'm expecting to do over $5 million. I think 5.5 is realistic. My goal was What are you going to make on it? 5.5. I should make over 500,000. far this year, I've made about 300,000. , what's your margin? My gross margin is around 73%. , you're spending a lot of money on advertising. I've been using some agencies that that I have do your marketing and stuff and they typically suck. My marketing I spend last month I spent a little bit over 100,000. Wow. , , it's probably going to be a lot cheaper to hire your own good SEO people. Yes. , that's the long-term goal is to bring this in house and congratulations, ? I'm not trying to take anything away from you. It's amazing. But we're trying to get a feel for where you're spending all your money, ? And typically the question would Kevin would ask is what's your rorowaz, ? What's your return on ad spend? And let's start with this customer acquisition cost for the new incremental customer. How much? my customer acquisition cost is around $20. My cost of goods is between 25 and $35. I have a question. We know nothing about you. Can you please tell us about you? I've always been an entrepreneur. When I was 5 years old, I was shining shoes at my grandpa's barber shop because I didn't get allowance. I had to go out and make money and find ways to go do things with friends. Soon as I got out of high school, I was in the Marine Corps. Spent 5 years in the Marine Corp. Thank you much. I appreciate that. Then after that, I went to college. I got my degree in physics. Nine years I was an engineer. And then last year I quit my job last July and now I do rough liners all the time. Good for you. What a great story. All , I've heard enough. I'm going to make you an offer. I've have gone on search for liners. There are thousands of them. There's nothing that proprietary about what you're doing other than your story is fantastic. Your customer acquisition cost is too high, but I'm going to make you an offer anyways. I'll give you the 200,000 for 20%. , Brandon, quick question for you. How much money did you put into it? , in in 2019, both my parents passed away within an 8week period. And it made me realize that life is short. And I didn't get a whole lot from them, but I got a little I got enough money to put $15,000 into taking my idea and making a product. Good for you. My god. And that was where the initial money came from and got me the beta version of the product I can start testing it and getting some customer feedback. And I want to do something with this money that makes me remember my parents. What you've done is phenomenal. You're a beast and it, ? You outwork everybody. And that's what great entrepreneurs do. Amazing. Now the bad news. The bad news from my perspective is you're spending 27% of your gross dollars at Amazon. Absolutely. And to me, as I look at businesses that sell online, that's scary. Yep. That's the fear for me because you can't control your own destiny now. , for those reasons, I'm out. You make me think of my Drop Stop guys. They've been doing phenomenal. I think we're 50 million in sales. They started to get all these knockoffs and recently it's become challenging. When I think about investing in something this, I'm concerned it's going to be a bit of a rough road. And , for those reasons, I'm sorry. I'm out. I'll make you an offer. [Music] You're lacking two things from what I'm seeing. Cash. You're going to need at least a million dollar credit line, which I would provide for you. And the other thing you're desperately lacking is you're not doing anything on social. But I can help you with the social and I sure can help you with the cash. , my offer is $200,000 or 20%. And I'll give you a million dollar credit line. 20% is a little bit higher that than I want to go on my baby that I love and I've put in much work. However, I think my margins could be exponentially better with the help of a shark. I would to bring that number down closer to 10%. I I think 10% I'm going to do over 5 million this year in revenue. What is that? 20some%. Brandon, there might be another offer. Two sharks are out. Brandon has two offers on the table for his interior vehicle cover business, Roughliners. But Robert may also be interested. Brandon, there might be another offer. Mark gave you the bad news. There's going to be a lot of challenges. But here's the good news. You're on Shark Tank. Y you keep going on Amazon you're doing. You start building the other socials Barbara is saying, and we can help you with that. , I love dogs. I I took a product here, Pup Box, and we sold it within 18 months for $12 million to PetSmart. I will give you 200,000 for greedy, greedy, greedy 15%. I I the number at 10%. I the number at 15%. I'm going to do over 5.5 million. I do have utility patents. 200,000 for 14%. Could we do a royalty deal to bring you to get your money back and bring you down to 10%. A dollar a unit. I'm going to do 50,000 units in the next 12 months or more. If I didn't grow at all. I'm going to do 50,000 units. 200,000 10% $5 royalty per unit. Oo, that's that's hard on the capital side because if I if I pay you back, I think it would happen in three years going off my 200,000 10% $3 royalty per unit. A dollar a unit. $2. I'll do that deal at a dollar unit. 10 come down to 10%. Yeah, to squeeze his head. Would you mind going in together? Dogs hate him. Brandon, I'll do the deal for a buck till I get my money back for 10%. to squeeze his head. I will do the same deal. Would you mind going in together? And this I don't get out of bed for 5%. I don't even bother. I I'll forget who you are for 5%. Brandon, I will only do this deal because I believe much in you. Seriously, Robert, let's do a deal. Yeah. Do I get to keep the dog? No, you can't keep the dog. Congratulations, Brandon. done. Yeah. Good job. I can't believe I'm here. I've watched every episode of this show and it's amazing to be here. You did a great job.

Pasco, my company created Community Made. Community Made is transforming how we manufacture and sell clothing in the United States. We're mobilizing teams of seamstresses, tailor, patter makers from underserved communities to make sustainable clothes. One of the places where this is working today is G's Ben, a rural, small, remote community in Alabama. Black quilters are famous there. Now, Pasco Community made is there creating dignified jobs that pay a living wage. We're ready to scale the success we're having in G's Ben across America. Sharks, I'm asking you for $500,000 for 2.5% of my company Pasco. Together, we can do good and make money. I know you don't. You're a bit fashion. I have a long career. I've been in this for 35 years. Before I ran most recently, I've was at Georgia Armani. Then I did Perry Ellis, Paco Rabon, Anne Klein. I did a collection for Target that was great selling there. a pedigree. You've been around. , , I've been around and that's why I'm doing this. And Americans today don't have jobs. And G's Ben, where I showed you, work's not there. And we're putting it there. All these clothes are being made now in the US. , we're a six-year-old business now. 2019, pre-COVID, we did $6.7 million. Wow. , I picked this up and I thought, Ooh, these are cute. , these are my cup of tea. This is extremely nice fabric. What is a pair of pants these cost to make? $43 to make. 110 is the average cost of one of our products. The , you're not offering manufacturing facilities for anybody. It's for your own line of clothes, ? now. now, we are. , what we're doing is we're building pods across the Yes. We have one in New York City with the first one we started during the height of CO. We the one on G's Ben came online a month ago and now we're building more. What are your net profits? We're We're not profitable yet. . . But our average cart now is 209. Uhhuh. . To acquire that customer, it's costing us $95. That's a lot, ? Yeah, it is. But to today, we did $1.9 million. We're looking to finish this year at 4.5. The last be profitable on the $4.5 million in sales. And if not, what will your losses be? How big a hole are you digging? We are digging a few million dollars still. Patrick, tell me why. Now we're getting to it. . Because we're building the building out the rapidly scaling our pods out. we were getting close to we're getting close to profitability at that $7 million that we were in in 2019. Our revenue dropped in co and Patrick tell me this. I don't understand why your revenue dropped. . I run apparel companies. Co was a killer for anyone who's selling dresses, selling prints, selling sequins. I'm looking at essentially what looks elevated loungewear here, ? It's what everybody was wearing during co I know because at SKIMS we couldn't keep anything in that looked anything this. I don't understand why your sales decreased badly. We didn't have the supply. We hit a supply chain nightmare. What was your supply chain issue? We couldn't get the inventory we wanted. we didn't build community made until July of last year. . you buy our product. you have a pivot going on. when co hit, you pivoted into this new thing called community made. . Yes. What I'm trying to figure out is pre- pivot, how did you sell clothes to get to 6.7 million in sales? Because post pivot it seems to be a challenge. That's my whole thing, ? I think my big issue with what you're doing is that it hasn't caught light. I'm wondering what isn't hitting with the customers and that's what I'm struggling with. It's the convers it's the conversation, ? It's how how do you how do you build the conversation out of that traditional place of of buying your ads, ? , we're spending a great deal of money and that's why we're in a beautiful climate now, ? What social lets us storyt tell and the beauty of what you've created is you've got an incredible story. , either you don't know how to sell it and tell that story or the customer simply isn't there for it. Yeah, Emma's exactly . . Because with your story, if it resonates, your cost of customer acquisition with this shouldn't be 90, ? She can come out with a new product and bam, hit the story there. ? Then I go back to Good American. , when we launched that, we started talking about size inclusivity, diversity, the premium denim market. With a oneweek runup, we sold a million dollars of denim on day one. The customers will get it. And I think that there must be some huge disconnect in what you're doing. I can't stress this enough, ? We are at the beginning of this story. I But you're not, Patrick. That's my only problem. Let me ask you one question. You are a talented designer, but have you ever been a CEO of a manufacturing business? No. No. I can tell. I don't know where you are in the continuum of when your story gets traction or not. I'm a pragmatic investor. Yes, I to take half a million dollars on pour and pour it on a business model that's already proven. , I'm adding gasoline to the fire. I don't think your flame is lit yet. I don't. I'm out. Yeah. I I I disagree with you. Of course, I get it. I disagree with you. It's my 500,000. I'll cry if I want to. And and that's why I get to disagree with you. my business, , Patrick? , I have to say when you gave your presentation, you brought me almost to tears. I thought that story was riveting. I can't imagine it not resonating with everyone who hears it, but you can have my investment because of the lack of clarity. . , sadly, I must say for this reason, I'm not . I completely understand. I'm grateful for all of your time. , we're we're building something that isn't built out there. I'm, , I was a a fan of you. I remember reading about you in Vogue on the CFDA list. I I knew your face the minute you walked in here. I think you need to take that same obsession that you have with how you're making things and turn it into some obsession with your customers because your customer is speaking and I don't think you're listening. It isn't for me. I don't think it's an investable opportunity. , I'm out. But I applaud you. Thank you. As I'm sitting next to somebody who's built a fabulous clothing line and brand and more and more, , I have not built a clothing line. I wouldn't know how to help you. And regretfully, I'm out.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nHi Sharks. I'm Kelly and I'm Alana. We're here from Tampa, Florida and we're seeking $75,000 for 10% equity in our company. Picture this. You're engaged planning your dream wedding and you're excited. You've picked out the venue. You've set your guest list. And suddenly you realize one of the most important guests doesn't have a plus one. This guest of honor can't have anyone accompany them, though. They need someone who can transport them to and from the venue, pick up after them, and maybe even escort them down the aisle. , that's where we come in. I didn't expect that. Fairy tale Pet Care. That is a big dog. my gosh. Fairy tale pet Care. We're your dogs plus one. That's , Sharks. We're the crazy dog ladies that started the wedding pet care industry. Back in 2015, we noticed engaged couples were facing a major problem. Your pet is your family, too. , of course, you want them to be a part of your special day. But the logistics can quickly become overwhelming. That's why we take care of absolutely everything you don't have to. From roundtrip transportation to providing attire rentals to coordinating every last detail, we make sure that your wedding day can be your dog's best day ever, too. , Sharks, who's ready to join us in bringing the positivity to the wedding industry by investing in the nation's first wedding pet care company? , that's a brilliant idea. That's a great idea for you guys. It is. Thank you guys for joining us. Go enjoy a piece of wedding cake. We're going to talk business. A B. Now, I'm imagining you two are dog lovers, but tell us about you and how did you come to think of this? Alana and I have been best friends since we were 13 years old. , we grew up together. We're college roommates and after we graduated, we both ended up working for a national hotel chain and we spent a lot of time talking with each other about what path we wanted to take in life. Then a light bulb went off. We had friends and family getting married that were having this problem as as couples at the hotel and we realized that this could be an actual service that couples are looking for. How do you charge for it? Our prices start with a 3hour minimum, which is how much? , our pricing currently starts at ,600 and that's going to be for one dog for the three hours. , $600 and then $100 an hour for each additional hour. How does a customer find you? , we started in Tampa, Florida. , that's where we're from. We have our headquarter location there. And then we franchised about a year ago. And , we do Yes. Yes. , growth, our growth model was always that we knew this needed to be across the nation. . I want to be in the dog babysitting business for weddings. I call you up saying my region I'm in Houston. I want to franchise from you. Do I get a region? Yes. For one territory, it's a $12,500 franchise fee. , we're starting with low startup fees. We do plan on increasing those as we grow out our How much per wedding? How much do I pay you? Yeah. , it's 9% royalties of gross sales. Do you have any data on the success of a franchisee or your success? Yeah. , officially launched launched our franchise in 2022 and in our first year, we sold our first 14 territories. Wow. That is four locations. What is your sales your sales with your company for the last year? We did $123,000 in sales and what did you net? our margins are about 70%. 66,000 of the revenue there was in our Tampa territory which we consider a two territory market and then that extra revenue was in those fringe counties around us and we've been testing new markets. Do you provide the wedding leads that they get the jobs or they're on their own and they have to find themselves? We have a great social media following. we , as you can imagine, we blew up on TikTok because weddings plus dogs, it's content gold. we've been fortunate in in that aspect. Who's your oldest franchisee? our first franchisee is the in the marriage capital of the world, Las Vegas. that was a exciting first franchise to launch. our top performing franchisee is doing about $2,200 a month and they've been in business for 9 months. 2,200 a month. Yes. With that money, 2,200, you can't do it full time. What are your gross sales for all of your franchises, your own shop this past year? If we look at this past year, including our franchises, what is it combined? It's about $80,000 in the franchises and then 123,000 from Tampa. How did you get to franchise when your sales aren't even 250,000? , it's unique enough, ? And it's expensive to do the franchising as , , and we did invest. I love dogs. Loved having our dog at our wedding. It's small. I think it's a great business for you guys. I I don't see how it would get to critical mass. It It's not for me. I'm out. We understand. Thank you much. You guys listen, I I always think it's great when people are clever and creative. It's not a big enough thing for me. I to get involved in things that I think I can grow huge. And I wish you good luck, but unfortunately on this one, I'm out. Thank you much. And to touch on the the growth aspect with our franchise model, we are collecting those initial franchise fees. anywhere from 12,500 to 44,000 for you guys, ? But here's here's my challenge. , if a territory has 3,000 weddings in the year and you do a thousand of those weddings, that's $3 million a territory and you guys will make your 9%. , , that's $270,000 times, , 30 territories you may have. That's not a big enough number to to get me excited as an investment. And that's for perfection, ? That's if you get every wedding with that has, , a hamster associated with it. I I don't think the scale is enough for me to get excited. for those reasons, I'm out. But congratulations. I think it's a brilliant idea. I think it's great for you guys. We are ready now to scale. , we did take the first year in franchising. I do understand that now those sales are low. Yeah, you have two sharks left, ladies. And one of them is calls himself Mr. Wonderful Wedding. It's true. It's true. And I do want to mention that cuz we haven't brought it up yet that we are a missiondriven brand. a big part of what we do has been getting involved in our community and helping shelter animals cuz from day one we knew that was what we wanted this company to also be and we if this doesn't work out for you at the end of radio commercials when they tell you my talking too fast that's got to be you doing great I have six brothers and sisters you learn to be quick and loud I you you're able to articulate an extreme high velocity I but you haven't articulated something that in my mind is the most important thing in the franchise business. Absolutely. Choosing the people. Y I remember when I invested in Cousins Main Lobster, they only were making $60,000 in only one month until they went to a franchise model. However, I learned a lot. It was my first franchise. I learned that it was easy to get a franchise in. It was difficult to keep the franchise in. And that's why we only opened the four and took a minute to make sure that these four were stable, solid. Yeah. before we continue, which is the way to do. Of those franchises that apply, what percentage do you accept? , we've had about 100 organic inquiries come in specifically about our franchise business and we've only accepted the four far and we still have 20 in the pipeline that we're working with that we don't know yet if they're going to. , you're being selective. The only missing with this story is numbers aren't big enough because franchises have to make a living. It's a great business. It's a lifestyle business. If you love if you love animals, this is a way to get paid. This is the way to go. Plus, we have that mission aspect. what? I'd to make an offer. All . What I love about your business is it's at its inception, which I love. I the fact you tried five people before going gang busters. I invested in three different franchises, all who went bust because they brought in the wrong people, and they grew too fast, and I could not slow them down to qualify their people. , what I also about your business is I think there's a huge market for dog lovers who want to work part-time and make a part-time living as supplementary income. , I'll make you an offer of $75,000 for 25%. Wow. Thank you much for your offer. You're welcome to entertain his offer. Kevin, you have an idea. I have a I I love death and weddings. I invest in all of them. I love it. Here's my offer. I'm sorry. The way I'm looking at it, saying to myself, it's small now. . I could make hundreds of dollars. , it's I would do I would do I would do the 75 ,000, but I want to be the third partner. I want 33 and a third. And then I put the accelerator on it. Ladies, two interesting offers. Yes. What are you going to do? Thank you much, Mr. Wonderful, for your offer. , yeah. Barbara, would you consider the $75,000 for 15%. , no. I'm going to put a heck of a lot of work into this because I know how to do franchisee better than anyone I've ever met. ? I know how to qualify people. I know how to build a team of the franchises. I know the cost of getting people together, how to do it properly. I know it inside and out. And I've done with franchisee. I think I'm a catch. , would you potentially be willing to do 75,000 for 20%. No, but I'll do for 22. It's a happy number. Deal. Deal. Deal. Wow. All . Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. We do appreciate your offer as . Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you much. Great job. This was an amazing experience. We're grateful. my god. my god. wow.

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Applause] [Music] Hi, my name is Megan Bowman. I'm from Ogden, Utah, and I'm the founder of a company called EcoFlower. I'm here today seeking $400,000 in exchange for 10% of my company. Let me share a little secret with you. Women are growing tired of the gift bouquet cycle. Get flowers, watch them die, procrastinate the trip to the garbage, and then wait for the day when somebody gives her another vase full of plant carcasses. There's a better way. Introducing EcoFlower. I found a floral solution that provides my customers with a beautiful bunch of flowers that not only last forever, but are also made with recycled and sustainable materials. We create with burlap, jute, twine, bamboo, book pages, beer bottles, wine bottles, lots of other materials that create timeless gifts, stunning bridal bouquets, and decoration for your home and businesses. Sharks together, we'll captivate the hearts of the women who will start to love getting flowers again. And I got each one of you gifts that I wanted to hand out before we start. , Robert, , thank you much. Wow, fancy. This is Croatia. This would be Croatia over here. And this is Kim's home country, Australia. And this is a heart. Yeah. Sniffle. Lori, I got you one of our buffets. This is beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Wonderful. I was , he has the whole something wonderful platform and I wanted to show you what I can do with weddings. . And this is a bridal bouquet and that's a matching bineer. And all of your stuff is scented. yours is lemon. That's black raspberry. , that smells nice. Smell that. Barbara, I got you a spring bouquet. I love that for springtime. And then Damon, I got you lapels for your jacket. Cool. And Mr. Cubin, those are lapels. Yeah, this has $140 in it. And if I don't get a deal today, you got to give it back cuz I'm a little tight on cash. Thank you much. Look at that. That's made with real money. I'm spending this. Do you individually make these, Megan? I used to make them and it got out of my hands and now it's a good sign. Yeah, we have two manufacturers that make them for us. Megan, it's pretty. But let me ask this question to the ladies up here. Lori, Barbara, if a man sent you this instead of real flowers, how would you feel about that? my. [Music] You want an honest answer? Megan, I can ask you. It's a lack of sensitivity. It's a good point. I feel I should feel precious a flower. I would rather have a real flower. Lori would rather have real flowers. Barbara would rather have real flowers. What does that say? My customers have a completely different story. I don't know what women say when you're in a wealthy community, but in the community I come from, if a man buys you flowers, spends $50 on it, you're upset with him. a lot of women are upset. They're , that $50 should have gone to towards groceries or a lot of other things. When they can keep it forever, the women cherish it more. You can prove us wrong. Here's how you can here's how you can prove us wrong. What are your sales? Lifetime sales are 2.8 million. I've only been open for a year and a half. , good for you. That's awesome. It's all direct to consumer through our website. Nice. What do you sell your bundle for? , it's about $59 for a bridal bouquet. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How did it happen that you started this business? , I saw an episode of Shark Tank and I'm , I wish I had an idea. , I called my dad and he said, remember the wood flowers that you used to sell when you were in high school? this is an idea you could do for Shark Tank. And I tried out when I was only two weeks into business. Of course, I didn't make it far. But without Shark Tank, I wouldn't have thought awesome on my path. You have a lot of competition. I know. I Nobody's selling them in the masses by the bouquets. They're for crafting. People are getting them on Etsy six at a time to put them in little hair bows for their kids, but nobody has a bouquet that you can buy online for a gift. What I can tell you is they're not used heavily in the wedding industry because people want live flowers. The industry is set up because we pass a lot of contacts. It's more and take commissions off selling flowers. I started weddings 3 months ago. Yesterday we did $100,000 in sales and 25,000 of it was weddings. Wow. What caused that? , we have a big problem at my shop with production and we purposely hold our marketing department back. But yesterday I said throw $4,000 at the ad and I want to see what you were coming up here and you wanted to brag. . . , you spent you spent $4,000 yesterday. I love her. And what was a typical day prior to yesterday in sales? A typical day is anywhere from $6,000 to 13,000. . , you created another $90,000 in sales, ? You're killing it. How much your own money is in this? $700. my god. But I have a business partner who helped me. , I was living in a one-bedroom apartment about to be homeless and I was on the news because I was trying out for Shark Tank for my first time and they did a whole news story on it. This guy saw me on TV and he called me up and he said, I want to invest. What do you need? And I'm , I need my rent to be paid and I need groceries. How much did you sell to him and for how much? He only put in $3,000 up front for inventory and then he paid my rent every month for a year. Megan, how much 25%. , hang on. He got 25% for $3,000 and paying your rent for a year. Unbelievable. Have you taken on any other investors? I tried off Shark Tank, got denied and the business was booming at this point. I was I could not keep inventory in I needed another investment. we found a local investment firm that gave us $30,000 for how much? Two guys. they each took 25%. 50% that leaves 25. you own 25%. , in total, you sold 75% of your business for roughly $35,000. That was hard times. Yes. Wow. That was a year and a half ago. Megan, one of the reasons you started a business is to retain equity, ? And you want to see it grow and that's your payback. I give you 400,000. I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. My secretary is going to own more stock than you do. That's ridiculous. You're getting wiped out. [Music] All six sharks are still in. While everyone is impressed with Megan's big sales in her faux flower delivery business, EcoFlower, they are concerned that she already gave away 75% of her company to other investors only a year and a half into her business. I give you 400,000, I would never do it for 10%. Let's say I did it for 30. Who is going to give me that stock? Because you're going to end up working for me as an employee. You're getting wiped out. You sold too much stock come from. It'll come from equal shares. We have a max that we're willing to go up to. , we can't , and my investors are tech guys. This is not their area. I want to get them out at some point. And , , later want to use my money to buy them out. I don't know, which would be smart. I feel you guys would have the contacts that could make that happen. I feel that equity could be used differently with people that know my industry better. , and they're open to it. , Megan, , you've heard the saying, it's better to own 10% of a billion dollar company than 100% of a That's why I'm here. , the the challenge is it's hard to build a billion dollar business. , when you're starting out in a small business, you should try to retain as much equity as you can for as long as you can, but you have 25% ownership. You don't control the business. You don't have the final say in the business. Who am I going to get into business with? They're wonderful people. They are. You got to hang on to the equity. , I'm out. , thank you, Megan. I spend more money on flowers than I'm embarrassed to admit than most people spend on groceries. I love flowers. I don't get these. I see these all over Manhattan in bathrooms usually. I don't even understand why people buy them, honestly. I don't get it. I have to love what I invest in. Great. , I am out. . Thank you. Look at you. , amazing. Amazing. You deserve much credit, but this is not me, ? This is not my area of expertise. I'm out. Thank you. I see these readily available out there everywhere. I don't think there's You're doing a great job yourself, ? There's not competition, though. But I don't have it. I'm first and best. I don't see it as the investment for me. , I'm sorry. Thank you. It makes it virtually impossible to invest in you without diluting you to a place where you are an employee. I'm still doing a great job. There's nobody doing what I'm doing. It's not investable for me. I'm out. I'm number one in this space. Come on, Damon. I'm going to do 4 million this year. Come on. I I have the same exact concerns that the other guys have that you started this whole business to not work for anybody now you're working for the company. have you talked to these tech investors and they have they confirmed that they are willing to sell their shares as ? They're willing to share at the price for sure. I need you to be vested in this business. I want to attempt to buy them out down the road and give you a bigger piece of this business. I'm going to offer you $400,000 for 25%. [Music] Wow. That wipes you out. You'll have no equity. No, that's not what I about it. Dilutes everybody about 6%. Did you do 20% that makes us all five equal? 555 is coming from all four partners to make me a fifth partner. Yes. [Music] You got a deal. . Thank you. my god. Thank you much. Thank you. You got to stay in the business, ? You promised me. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you got a deal, too. Made me 140 bucks. my gosh. I would have got that back.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Ogden, Utah, Croatia, Australia, Manhattan (GPE), EcoFlower, Shark Tank (ORG), Etsy (EVENT), first, fifth (ORDINAL)\n\n**Key Phrases:** shark tank, a lot, the business, a deal, real flowers, a year, this business, an employee\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 procrastinate: trip\n  \u2022 be: way\n  \u2022 introduce: EcoFlower\n  \u2022 find: solution\n  \u2022 create: gifts\n  \u2022 captivate: hearts\n  \u2022 get: one\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 get: one\n  \u2022 thank: you\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.21)\n\n**Topics:** business, flower, megan, bouquet, shark",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Hi Sharks. I'm William and I'm Kristen. We're a husband wife dynamic duo, co-founders of Uprising Food from Cincinnati, Ohio. We're here today seeking 500,000 for 3% equity in our company. Hello Sharks. We want to revolutionize health and it starts with bread. We teamed up with the best artisan bakers in the industry to bring you the healthiest, tastiest, most powerful bread in the game. And did we mention our bread, also known as the Uprising cube, is keto, paleo, and boosts gut health? That's . And it's dairy and gluten-free. Some say it even tastes it's straight out of heaven. We've truly done the impossible. Our cubes are packed with fiber and created with clean and boosted superfood ingredients. Now, who wants to join our health revolution and bring this mouthwatering taste heaven bread to the masses? Woo! Woo! Now, who wants to taste heaven? I want to show you up here. , what we have today is for you to experience live the uprising grilled cheese. We also have French toast. And this is a plain piece of the bread, ? Yes, exactly. I want to try that, too. Go ahead, jump in. , we didn't stop at bread. We also created chips. And yes, we have sales on both. We are brand builders through and through. I worked at Proctor and Gamble and Kristen works at another CPG company. It's important to us that we bring an aesthetic and an inspiration to our brand building efforts. It's got a little bit of a sponginess to it. Almost a cake. Chewy. It's chewy. What? And what is that? What's with that? , that is designed on purpose because we want you to have a specific mouth feel with this bread. This lasts one to four weeks in the fridge. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's amazing. And that's with no preservatives. I'm going to give you a little credit for the taste cuz I've tried a lot of these products and they taste utter The bread is good. This is pretty good. What does this cost? How much? That goes for $12 there. Wo. Wo. Yes. For a little loaf of bread that. Yes, there's a lot of power in that, guys. I think the bread tastes absolutely delicious, but I can't get over the price. 12 bucks for this tiny little half a loaf of bread. , how does that compare in the market? , I want to find a $5 bill in the bread. Do what ? I don't understand that. , this is not a basic bread. We're looking to upgrade bread. Americans are frankly getting sick because of the foods that were industrialized and scaled. My father is the type of person who represents the masses. Now he's an annuity for the medical system. He was given four weeks to live. We intervened with food and my dad is still here today. When we think about what we're doing here, it's not about us being successful. It's about the mission of helping people and we will drive success by solving this problem for society. I I agree with everything you're saying and I totally agree about the disease factor. My dad died from that. same issue. Irish guy, lots of starch, lots of white flour, killed him. But not everybody in America can afford for eight slices $12. That's expensive. Yeah, exactly. What are the revenues of this business? first year in business 2019, we did 85k topline. Second year in business 2020, the pandemic hits, we did under a million topline. How's that possible? What did you do? , hold on. It gets better. It gets better. First six months of 2021, 2.1 million year to date. Pretty good. I almost want to ask you for proof. We're experts at digital marketing. , now, we can deliver a consumer for under $50 customer acquisition cost. That is a lot for what you sell because you need a lifetime customer to overcome that initial. Yeah. Bingo. It would be a lot if we weren't in such a high frequency consumable. We got to get to grips with these numbers because the sales last year were impressive. But what's your profit? We are not cash flow positive yet. We have under a million in net losses in sorry for last year. Yes, we sell a one loaf for $12 that cost us $525 to make. But let's talk shipping. Once you take that down for shipping, we clear about a 30% margin once you average our bundle together. And you make about $3.60 per loaf. Yep. 500,000 for 3% imputes a $16.6 million valuation. Explain why you're worth $16.6 million. . We're on track to do 5 million this year. As you've heard, we've done 2.1 million year to date. Other companies us, we believe can get a 6x multiple in market. But you don't make money yet. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No, absolutely not. , when do you become profitable? Ever? , we we will become profitable when we reach a certain level of scale. No kidding. You will become profitable when you reach a certain level of scale. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. All sharks are still in, but they are concerned about the lack of profits for William and Kristen's healthy bread company, Uprising Food. Are you saying you're going to make money if you hit 5 million this year? No. Absolutely not. when do you become profitable? Ever. Our goal is to drive topline revenue. What is your exit strategy? Yeah, we would to either exit the company to a larger multinational or we could foresee taking this company public at some point. I don't think I've ever sat and spent this time in my seat and heard more fancy words in my entire life. All . I think if I were to put any money into your business, I would not sleep a wink tonight. Wow. . It's not even a business that I'm listening to you about. It's a cause. The uprising, the battle has begun. But the bottom line here is I don't trust you to even protect my money. And sadly for me, that's the reason I'm out. Let me tell you a quick thing. Here's I want to share a few things with you. I the concept of healthier foods, ? And I do think that down the road it will have great potential because this is on trend for what people want. But sadly, it's also too big an ask for me, your valuation. , I'm sorry. I'm out. . Thank you, Laura. Thank you. I'm stuck as an investor on this 500,000 for 3%. For this deal to work, you're going to have to exit at close to half a billion valuation for me to get my money back. I'm out. . Thank you, guys. I think the product is great. , I consider myself a foodie and definitely a bread girl. And I thought this bread was , great. But equally, I think that the, , the sign of a good entrepreneur is to know the climate that you're in. And I think for, , many years now, those of us that are in direct to consumer businesses have been able to scale our businesses and do exactly what you guys said you were going to do, chase the top line without real consideration for becoming a profitable business. You guys did not come in and demonstrate what your path to profitability is. Great point. You missed it. You spoke about all of your order economics, which ain't that great, by the way, because you're paying too much to acquire the customer. And as everybody said, you're not profitable on your first customers. , I think for me, , I'm out. Thank you. Yeah. Guys, look, why don't you run the company to be profitable now? Why didn't you go after being profitable by the month to to be able to sustain all this? That's exactly what we did, Mark. We you lost a million dollars in the journey to get here. We aggressively drove CAC to the floor. We've been the number one lowest CAC in the field. That's such a nonsense parameter. You start small. You got a nice little product and whatever you do, you go door todoor. You go online. You sell it locally and you make money and you grow. But now your back is against the wall, ? Because you're losing money on every sale. the more customers you acquire, the more money you lose unless you can make sure that you're selling them a whole lot more products and your products are expensive and the bread on sliced you get it and it's what do I do now? , you don't take a bite out of it. That crust is important to preserving the product. People buy that product for the trifecta of three reasons. You can't find something this healthy that tastes this good that's this fresh. Then why don't you say that? Why don't you say that? That was the best thing you said all day. Exactly. That was the best sales pitch you've made. The the packaging that you're looking at there is unfortunately our Gen 2 packaging before we dialed in that positioning statement and figured out that was the winning combo. You're driving me nuts. , look. We are constantly I know. . . You're overselling with all the jargon when you have an authentically good product. . Your whole little speech on crust is everything you should be saying and selling this because of that. I want a product that's going to give me all these things that I can't get from a sliced product. That's all you had to say. simplify, focus on the product, and I'm out. Thank you guys. much. Good luck with the line. Thank you.

from New York our company is trunkster and we're seeking 1.4 million dollars in exchange for five percent wow sharks meet trunkster the world's first and only roll top suitcase trunkster's minimalist

trunkster is loaded with smart features we've engineered the world's first self-contained handle skills you can pack under the weight limit and avoid costly fees sharks is there anything worse than

offers a global location tracking with proximity sensors trunkster gives you all of this plus it's made from the highest quality materials using a patent-pending assembly process for lightweight and rigid durability not to mention how sexy it is this is the biggest luggage Innovation since Wheels rated 50 years ago and we need your help to establish ourselves as the game changing luggage brand worldwide who's in most the product let me see a preface the inside how do you open it you can pull it out there you can open a standing up or laying down that's the beauty of it can this take a hit yes they can absolutely take a hit they've been tested to every luggage standard international standards may I see how much that weighs I want to pull it absolutely and they'll weigh less than eight pounds when they're finished how did you come up with this idea I was in a luggage store and I realized wow every luggage brand is the same as a millennial I to buy a brand that has a story behind it that comes from Grassroots Travelers there's no brand this Market corporate they're such millennials [Music] they're supposed to get corporate 1.4 million for five percent which one of you do I absolutely tear to pieces now on a 28 million dollar valuation all are you not selling this yet we are pre-selling this because we are still in the manufacturer pre-selling and you have a 28 million evaluation yes you see any problem with that no because I'm going to explain eight months ago we became the most crowdfunded travel campaign in history on Kickstarter we raised 1.4 million dollars we hit our goal in one hour today we've pre-sold two million dollars of this bag which sells itself we didn't even ask how much one of these costs yeah we retail them for 3.95 and the cost is about 20 of that exactly it's prototype but all of these people have bought in haven't tried it these are the first samples off the line we're pretty close to shipping next month we have 5 000 units that are being are about to be on the assembly line that we shipped out next month we have a guy they're checking on the quote the quantities yeah why is it worth 28 million dollars that was my first question because I never answered we're estimating three million dollars in sale this year far we've done two million dollars next year we're estimating about nine million dollars in sales we're going to make this first of all into a billion dollar company and we're doing we're going to disrupt the luggage industry the same way the mattress industry has recently been disrupted and that's why offering a premium product at a significant discount to Consumers luggage of this you're gonna sell everything online all online all this luggage Queen is this revolutionary is different the clever is it worth 28 million nothing's wrong another story you guys know it's a huge ass it's a huge size for that HSN HSN reached out and said but you're pricing that as though it's already now ask me if it's worth 28 Min and I'll tell you no I gotta tell you I think the business is probably worth five to eight million dollars today you put that money in your pocket that's money you made you put that money in your pocket but that's anecdotal it's one-off don't have any track record there would you sell 30 percent of the company to Robert for 1.4 million which reflects his more conservative five million dollar valuation wouldn't you absolutely not I've seen from all the other luggage companies where we're running scared and interested in what we're doing is we can grow this guys good 10 million 20 minutes we have other products nobody silence are you prepared to have flexibility on your 28 million dollar ass all sharks are still in but they question the high valuation of Gaston and Jesse's smart luggage company trunkster prepared to have flexibility on your 28 million dollar ass this reminds me of if I may share a story that in January we're choosing our Factory partner and we weren't able to get there on the but he told me to say this listen he's from Long Island listen somebody's going to manufacture trunks it either it's going to be you or it isn't whoever it is that person's gonna make a lot of money and I can tell you that was true then and it's true now partner is making a lot of money I will say to that we're reasonable we're willing to negotiate we understand this is a business and we want the partners how much of your own cash did you guys put in we spent five thousand dollars to launch the kickstarter campaign yeah that's all the money we invested you haven't shipped anything yet your 5000 is now worth 28 million dollars I'm lucky to be here what an opportunity that's a great return also no we should say something about the product that our product has three things that few products have in combination anymore listen everybody agrees it's interesting and even Lori clean the luggage if I if I could be the exception on the product I find a couple of things wrong one it's Sleek but it's extremely masculine product line experience you're doing others but I'm judging by this prototype secondly I think it's too heavy in addition to the fact that most people soft luggage not hard luggage and lastly you haven't had your consumer base tested out they haven't received it yet you're asking us to invest a lot of money with absolutely no feedback from the guy who's going to use it we have had people testing testers came back with positive reviews and for those reasons there's many unanswered questions but magically the two of you have convinced me that there's something there I'll give you the 1.4 million for 30 percent maybe that's all legitimate offer Mark can laugh all he wants he's not making an offer that's the offer I see because of all the unanswered questions this isn't an investment we're going on a trip together and when we go on this trip together that's what he's saying and I think it's fair in fact I'll join him if he wants a partner I you guys I'll do that deal I'll go 50 50 if he wants to mitigate his risk a little bit Kevin I appreciate the offer I don't want Kevin to go on this trip with me because there are countries Kevin's not allowed to go into I will make the same offer except I want 37 percent as ludicrous as you are your valuation is insane I'm sitting here thinking about losing my money on the one hand I do think that there's a lot of things that can be done with it I have licensing connections I know this world but on the flip side say I give you the money and something goes wrong with it don't anticipate it but it could happen I would give you the 1.4 million to fund purchase orders you want at 15 percent [Music] we would love to hear if Mark maybe has something to say the product's interesting I see what you're trying to accomplish now I want you to put yourself in orange juice how much get back and win we expect to be making six million dollars in profit next we can pay you back next year it's a simple question but I don't want one million absolutely we're aiming to make a billion dollar company you have us working together in your mind there's these big numbers you can pay back but when we do the math based off of the equity you're offering us the numbers don't calculate two big numbers and make 20 million dollars next year what's five percent of 20 million dollars a million dollars you didn't look at it from our perspective gentlemen I always love Mark more than anyone on the panel because he's got the most bucks but let me tell you Lori's the best partner would it be an option to work together or that would negotiate when we take one moment yeah thank you 10 you're comfortable give 10 with two sharks helping us all what are you gonna do Mark and Lori we would to offer you five percent of trunk surf for 1.4 million dollars we will also pay you back the full 1.4 million within 24 months and if we don't pay you back within that time frame we will double your Equity stake 10 percent and we will offer you one dollar in perpetuity starting from when the when the money is paid back all that's your offer Mark Lori what do you got [Music] I would take that deal yeah we'll take that deal hang on Wow [Music] thank you much wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel then for that reason I'm out\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:**

they're dark that is for outdoor swimming we have ranges from super light one totally clear to dark and the design of the goggle means that you have a great peripheral view which is super useful you can navigate better how big is the goggle Market in the US and Europe $2.2 billion 2.2 billion I'm not suris I'm not surprised I have three young Sons they wear goggles all of their friends wear

we've been growing three times every year it's logical my glasses are made for me why have swimming goggles never been custom made we are a triathlete both of us I went on a vacation I forgot my goggles but I had to swim and then I purchased all the goggles that I could find none of them fit me then I called the best triathlete that I knew at the time that was rasos my nephew he's your nephew yes where are you from We're from Denmark I don't understand why you're only charging $55 why aren't these $99 we wanted to charge in the middle of the other highend goggles we didn't want price to be an issue for our customers what does it cost to make it it cost $14 and what is the customer acquisition cost that is $24 guys nobody comes in here asking for $500,000 for 22% that's always to protect your previous investors tell us how much money have you raised we've raised $1.5 million at what valuation the last valuation that we had was $9 million can you walk us through how the ramp has gone over let's say the last 3 years in 2018 when we delivered the first goggles our Revenue was 180 the year after was 370 last year it was 1.2 million wow and far this year we're at 1.5 impressive where are you based and where do you manufacture I moved to Charlotte and Rus moved to New York we convinced our wives to make the BET and move to the US why did you choose to move to the US Market here is better and the relative number of swimmers is slightly higher than Europe then you're manufacturing where is that done we get some of our parts from China and then all the customization happens in Charlotte North Carolina do you have any type of IP coverage we have a Utility Patent on the fitting algorithm you manufacture the goggles and you have to customize them to fit what is that process yeah we used Advanced robotics technology to do it are you using third party robotics or are you developing all the software are control the robot is of course made by us not all companies can make robotics Mark it's a goggle company not a robotics no it's a robotics company that makes goggles now exactly exactly look when you have a unique Niche and you're developing a new category it's not where you are it's where you'll be I'll offer you the $500,000 but I want 75% and I don't want you to negotiate with everybody cuz you already know that on you that means he doesn't want you to hear anything else if you're more concerned about that Equity the two of us have an offer you may find interesting guys I already have a robotics company that I'm an investor in I have ai companies I have machine learning companies I have AR companies and obviously being in the sports industry I have you may not want to give up 7 and a half% that's why if you if that's too much then I'll listen to a counter you have it let me give you an offer that two sharks want to give you and you can get both the sales and the technology how about this deal Venture debt deal 500,00 all between the two of us and we're going to charge you $3 a unit until we recoup 1.5 million then the royalty goes away but we're only going to ask for 5% equity and you get two sharks or Rasmus let me tell you my daughter was a world- class swimmer in fact she was ranked in the top 10 in the world in the butterfly when she was 12 years old I've spent 18 years at swimming pools I get this market I'll do 500,000 for 5% no royalty I want to say what you need are Partners with Mr Wonderful what you're going to get nothing nothing exactly nothing except for what will help you scale your business I've been the CEO of three different companies in Silicon Valley I know how to build extremely large audiences cost effectively you have an amazing product but now how are we going to bring it to the masses that's the problem that I've solved over the last 20 years not wait a minute you need somebody who will help you blast these out sell them I'm a product person I to blow up sales I to move fast and I to Blitz the market and that's what I'm good at Lori do you have an offer not going to offer you Tech but I'm going to offer you a lot of sales I have Mark and I have Robert who have both given you offers and they're on the tech end and I would join either one of them to blow up the sales I'm asking them do either if you want me to come in that was a good question but I think that it comes down to what were you hoping to get here today in the next short while do you need to boost sales do you need to boost strategy do you need to boost Tech guys guys we we've all been entrepreneurs and we know you can't choose you have to do both you need to generate sales and you need to answer the Strategic questions about how to best build the business business n has a fantastic track record doing this he

happy with the 5% how do we split that 5% guys we'll drop down 1% to be more competitive because we're asking for five we'll go to four we want that royalty structure in place but it's not Perpetual we get back our Capital it's not even that great return but we stay in the game you get three times the capital no we're only making a million bucks off 500,000 we're willing to go down on the equity and guys I said I'll listen to a counter offer and we have a counter and will we yeah Robert and I are going to do the 500,000 6% no royalty no royalty wasn't the offer five it was that was the first of us and now it gotten worse got worse by a percent but you get two sharks I'm happy to do 500 ,000 for 5% on my own I think Lori brings a tremendous amount of it that gives you the sales but we need

Amber he my name is Kyle bird I'm head of product and a co-founder at Amber sharks today we are raising $200,000 in exchange for 20% stake within Amber sharks how many times You' been at an airport and had your phone tragically Die In Your Arms our pain all too the fact is we didn't want to walk around with chargers in our pockets or give our phones to bartenders to charge our phones in a public space we saw a problem and we came up with a solution shark's Amber is a mobile phone charging station that is completely free to use we secure your device in one of our seven compartments using biometric scanning namely fingerprint scanning we made it super super simple let's show you how it works simply walk up scan their fingerprint choose one of the available compartments and whenever they're done they simply rescan their finger and one of the doors will unlock we realized that Amber wasn't a free secure way for people to charge their phones in a public space but could also Drive revenue for venues by keeping people around longer and heightening the overall customer experience we want to put Amber in bars restaurants gyms movie theaters Arenas anywhere the list goes on and on sharks by securing an investment today we can make our first big push into seeing Amber and venue Across the Nation now who wants to secure deal with Amber is the product shipping we are pre-revenue I love that word pre-revenue we graduated a few weeks ago from college where'd you go to school James Mass University in Virginia Bill walk me through the premise you walk into a bar sure I'm a bar owner how much are you going to charge me we will either charge you $2,000 outright for the unit or you can lease it either on a 69th I buy it for 2,000 that's it there's no moreeven or you get it on your wall for $150 there and it's it's a monthly one 50 it's a convenience for the bar but it's not something they have to have now people are charging their phones in bars they're giving them the bartenders to Waites and waiters that's a liability it's hey can I get my phone that waiter waitress may have left gotten off work and now they have a lost phone guys you said a door locks I didn't see the door lock the locks in here is what we're using for testing we're currently sourcing our locks through Master Lock there will be a door on there yes Bill have you tested a fingerprint scanner we have we test it all in the back end cuz I'm the cyber security space here's what I know about fingerprint scanners they can be finicky except for the high-end ones with all du respect to you the idea of you walking up once putting your finger in there and it recognizing you and the door coming down is ludicrous we have a big security Center the fingerprint scanner that we pay for people to get into that Center was over 50,000 there's no way for that price point you're going to buy a fingerprint scanner that's going to work that quickly here's how it's going to work someone's going to come up they're going go once they're going to go twice they're going to go three times they're going to pull it off the wall yeah they and and this is before they've had something to drink tell us how much you've invested because you've got to build prototypes on our College budgets we are sitting I think we're around $11,000 and what does it cost you to make a unit now we can make the unit for $1,000 with $1,000 this is going to end badly that is such a bad bus what are you you're saying you're saying the cost of it to buy is $2,000 it's it's $150 a month or $2,000 out why would a bar pay you 2,000 when you go to the airport those guys who have the big charges they issue it for free because they want to do their advertising why wouldn't a bar put one of those free devices behind the bar why does anybody need this I think there's many personal charging devices and I'm in the space now we're creating something that is light years ahead this I'm out the cost is horrible guys you've got to get this down under $100 and and that's exactly what we're trying to do far away and I feel bad cuz you put in a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears wait wait no sweat and tears blood in the water blood we've had a lot of interest from festivals and say larger scale venues conventions we we we developed a products putting it on a stand and having say 14 units look whenever you have a lot of people one of the things you don't want to do is create a reason for them to congregate in one spot waiting for something all you're doing is creating more lines and then the finger scanner someone wet someone's grimy you're at a festival it's not going to be a clean environment this is definitely not for me I'm out there's only one answer to this I have to hire you both I can fire you this is horrible how do you think this has any chance of surviving and working I hate this much it's incredible it's one of the worst ideas I've ever seen I'm out I have absolutely no interest in this business I'm out we do have competition there are a few comp there's a lot of competitors your biggest competitor is free you've come out with an incredibly elegant solution to free look I'm out good luck thank you guys much for time I think that was the shortest pitch it's the worst pitch that's why it's horrible I thought you put your glass there and fill it up hey he left this the cost was an issue the security was an issue I know it works we've tested it a million times I would probably go rail Hersh backck in the teth that's not that's do she want me to be honest I'm being honest before

run through quick all the scenarios give me four or five where you think someone would use this 2020 one of the top lines that was used was you're on mute now at times have you heard a dog bark doorbell ring different scenarios will assume and talking and they don't realize they're on mute everyone's trying to get their attention and they don't have that indication that they are why not do a browser extension though and make it big on the screen where everybody's looking because it takes up screen real estate you don't want to take up additional space on your screen there's eight different conferencing platforms when you're interfacing with all those different conferencing platforms it's not easy our button you plug it in you press the button it mutes and unmutes how much you selling them for or selling them for 39 retail and what do they cost to make it's 11.62 cents now you've got to come up with a way to sell it do something fun with it on Tick Tock you have got to be great content creators you're a product and you haven't figured out how to sell it you're not even close that's what I think you need to be successful for those Reasons I'm not I'm sorry to hear that Mark I think this goes to zero in retail in about 90 days it'll be a discount bin for nine bucks that's not a problem this should be completely done online part of the strategy is a business to

manufacturing it at 11 ouch we would love to work with any one of you I'll give you an offer but the problem is I have to redo your business every one of the Sharks said something that's critical you got to make these things for a dollar fifty and at the end of the day this gotta be 19.99 maybe 14.99 certain companies are targeting 9.99 unfortunately I have to give you a sharp deal for 200 000 for 50 50. that's not an unreasonable offer for what you guys got here the evaluation is crazy it is crazy but I have to put much work and I'm probably gonna have to give percentages to a bunch of people

dollars for 25 equity in my company sharks my fingers were hurting do why why because after 12 hours of coughing and pasting into a spreadsheet my hand was cramping into a Lobster Claw the dreaded Lobster Claw the throbbing red pain in that you get from copying and pasting all day control scene control V see I copy and paste on average 50 times a day I've had customers tell me over 1 000 times a day you can see how surprised I was when I tried to buy a copy keyboard but it wasn't for sale I had to make it then the copy keyboard was born the world's first copy and paste keyboard I did it for all of hand kind because look how relaxed the hand is with the coffee keyboard and notice how cramped the hand is with the shortcut Ctrl C and control V because the shortcut Ctrl C and control V was made for the computer but not for the consumer no longer do you need to control C or control V plug it in USB plug and play Ready means you never need to call i t but wait that's not all because the copy keyboard went viral on social media with over 20 million views wow sharks what do you say who wants to lend a fan you can lay on the beach and all copy and paste our profits my God why were you copying and pasting 50 times a day what do you do I was a former e-commerce manager and I was put in a lot of documents in spreadsheets P L's and I had to copy and paste over 50 times a day doing my sales I think it's a great tool for accountants Financial Industries even as a present during Christmas last season this was the president the top tech gift of 2021 I self-proclaimed yeah how do that maybe maybe I don't know that but guys I need money because I need to provide enough of this inventory and have it ready because last holiday what happened was I posted the video on December 1st on December 2nd I already had twenty thousand dollars worth of orders and I programmed those I package those I ship those out for my kitchen I need a little bit more money to help me bring my product costs down they can go from from nine dollars and fourteen cents which we're at now to all the way to six dollars and fifty cents with a two thousand order what do you sell them for we sell them for 19.99 for the standard USB version we sell them for 24.99 for our LED version can I give you my sales now sure yeah my sales now are forty two thousand hundred nine dollars for less than a year we did

my phone was going off and I'm you're good at that but I I was worried number one is I needed to fill fulfill all of these products and I need to make my customer happy because I can take all the orders in the world let them keep flowing in but I cut the orders off and made them all pre-orders after I saw a big dip in all the orders because of that are wait list orders because a pre-order is before you ever sold anything a waitlist orders after you sold things and then you are putting people on waitlist because you're out of inventory I that sorry I never thought about that that sounds good yeah let me ask you a quick question patent yes or no no patent but let me tell you something wait wait stay on that that stops me from copying pasting this idea myself thank you I thought you would ask me this question it's not the big fish that eats the small fish it's the quick fish that eats the slow fish and I am the quick fish all that's not what does this have to do with fish I that you're saying you're gonna get out there bigger faster stronger than anybody else absolutely your competition you do realize if somebody knew what they were doing you could assign those keyboard

brothers and we're both Physicians I'm Richard and I'm Albert our company is rollerdoc and we're seeking fifty thousand dollars for twenty percent of our company and as Physicians we're constantly communicating with our peers our patients and with other medical professionals and what we've realized is that when it comes to communication medicine is not in the 21st century for crying out loud we're still using pagers to communicate what is this the 80s rolodoc is the cure for the old school communication that exists in medicine rolock allows for secure email between patients Physicians and other medical professionals the mobile app that allows for instant messaging between them take a look at this sample patient profile here's Mr Wonderful's page he's entered in his information including his medical problems he looks good looks he's suffering from a heart condition a cardio for those non-medical nerds this is a condition when a person is born without a heart not to worry Mr Wonderful because you can then search for Physicians by State Specialty or insurance provider let's pick surgery choosing surgery in Arizona lets you find this young good-looking surgeon you can then view his profile and send him a message the surgeon receives the message instantly and can reply at his convenience sharks with your investment we will revolutionize the way we communicate in medicine but most importantly you'll help us get rid of these pagers and make some money doing it is the point that you can personally communicate to the doctors that you have online because doctors could be inundated with emails and personal messages how would they ever keep up with it what we're trying to do is bring social media and the social network to the medical profession what's the social element you didn't see you let's say let's say Kevin O'Leary moves to La wants to find a plastic surgeon there get even sexier than he is already I don't need that looks fantastic even sexier I'm gonna have a heart attack if he wants to go find a doctor now he's gonna do a search engine he's gonna be inundated with inaccurate information and he's going to be end up as confused as when he started are you up and running at all we are in Alpha Testing now we've got 50 users on it our personal connections that are using it verifying how it works how many doctors or total users total users I'm looking at my own situation my doctor's in Boston when I have aches and pains and I'm on the road I can email him as I do he communicates back to me that way and suggests that I go see a specialist when I get home all done by email the organization in Boston which has my medical files shares them amongst hospitals we've got that technology now when I arrive at the specials I have all my history they know who I am what are you adding to that equation we're adding social media doctors want to Brand themselves want to advertise you create a profile on rollerdoc and it'll create a profile on another social network but those social networks aren't safe let's take a step back how am I going to convince you the physician to put your profile up there and detail the services that you offer that's easy there's 800 000 us visitors I didn't ask what the market was there's a hundred places to put profiles what are you going to do to convince doctors you have business connections we have medical connections we're going to launch in Arizona Texas and Chicago connections are we we have access to multiple doctors multiple databases we're going to tell them that this is the best way to Brand yourself and how are you going to tell them I'm pulling teeth I should be a dentist are you personally going to quit your practice you're going to stop doing surgery and you're going to make the call no this day and age we can do it with electronics we can either buy a database what Mark get an email this is dangerous how are you vetting these doctors there's a valid concern because you don't want to be reading about somebody that isn't a surgeon that's offering heart surgery that would be a bad outcome I don't think they'll be able to get anybody it's going to be dangerous if you can't get any doctors let's go through the logical progression yeah my doctor gets an email it's from Roll of Doc never heard of him delete wait a second you haven't explained how I make money which is the most important thing my doctor is hip to technology why would he use this and how would I profit from him getting on board he's going to use this because he's going to want to attract new patients provide social media to them he keeps on saying social media social media this is all one-to-one communication you're not going to let him tell me how I make money because there's no chance of you making money on this do is that the answer targeted advertising is it in a secure environment you can do targeted advertising not gonna happen you can look there's social networks that are already doing this for physician only mobile mobile networks within physician to physician which has a whole different set of security issues than communicating with patients correct but you can Target The Physicians I see this as a liability nightmare because you are putting people in touch with their doctors they're answering back without maybe seeing a patient knowing what's going on this my opinion there's a lot of risk in it I'm out what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring social media to medicine and Albert let me go back tomorrow you keep saying social media then you go to email email is not social media doctors are constantly posting things on Twitter and at other websites and how do you use that that's what we have we have the capability of being a social network instead of saying follow me on XX site you say follow me on Roll It Off I get that you're trying to recreate Twitter and Facebook onto rollodoc correct but I want to do this I face to face because you're doctors worst presentation ever I'm out that was me ever you guys should be smart enough to know you didn't show us any of the social media you showed his profiles and talk to us about email you didn't tell us at all how are you going to get there it was horrible Mark I think you're being a bully they might be I am being a bully then they deserve to be bullied it's hurtful to watch you I would have to agree with Mark I think it was the worst sales presentation I've heard we're not presenters we're Physicians guess what I don't care what your background is if you're looking for money you got to sell your idea that business plan is unclear I'm out with all due respect I don't think you've explained how you're going to get users how you're going to monetize it I don't see the business I'm out I was intrigued frankly it's depressing because I new ideas in the medical space they're forever if they work but at the end of the day I can't connect the dots regarding how I make money I'm out fair enough thank you thank you all [Music] they weren't prepared they were arrogant thinking that they were going to be able to wing it and everybody doesn't know any better it's our baby man you're bummed out I was expecting to be able to portray it a little bit better than we did protein is never wasted when a death occurs what is that it means that others will see what happened here they'll learn from their mistakes they won't make the same mistake I don't mind sacrificing a couple of doctors if it means the next two doctors can make me money they were about one thing what you have no heart before you go

from New York our company is trunkster and we're seeking 1.4 million dollars in exchange for five percent wow sharks meet trunkster the world's first and only roll top suitcase trunkster's minimalist roll top tour provides instant access to your belongings whether in the back of a taxi or at the check encounter you're a quick slide away from your passport book or sweater and that's beginning trunkster is loaded with smart features we've engineered the world's first self-contained handle skills you can pack under the weight limit and avoid costly fees sharks is there anything worse than running out of power on the go with trunkster you've got juice all to yourself via the built-in USB ports powered by a removable battery and forget about lost luggage nightmares because trunkster offers a global location tracking with proximity sensors trunkster gives you all of this plus it's made from the highest quality materials using a patent-pending assembly process for lightweight and rigid durability not to mention how sexy it is this is the biggest luggage Innovation since Wheels rated 50 years ago and we need your help to establish ourselves as the game changing luggage brand worldwide who's in most the product let me see a preface the inside how do you open it you can pull it out there you can open a standing up or laying down that's the beauty of it can this take a hit yes they can absolutely take a hit they've been tested to every luggage standard international standards may I see how much that weighs I want to pull it absolutely and they'll weigh less than eight pounds when they're finished how did you come up with this idea I was in a luggage store and I realized wow every luggage brand is the same as a millennial I to buy a brand that has a story behind it that comes from Grassroots Travelers there's no brand this Market corporate they're such millennials [Music] they're supposed to get corporate 1.4 million for five percent which one of you do I absolutely tear to pieces now on a 28 million dollar valuation all are you not selling this yet we are pre-selling this because we are still in the manufacturer pre-selling and you have a 28 million evaluation yes you see any problem with that no because I'm going to explain eight months ago we became the most crowdfunded travel campaign in history on Kickstarter we raised 1.4 million dollars we hit our goal in one hour today we've pre-sold two million dollars of this bag which sells itself we didn't even ask how much one of these costs yeah we retail them for 3.95 and the cost is about 20 of that exactly it's prototype but all of these people have bought in haven't tried it these are the first samples off the line we're pretty close to shipping next month we have 5 000 units that are being are about to be on the assembly line that we shipped out next month we have a guy they're checking on the quote the quantities yeah why is it worth 28 million dollars that was my first question because I never answered we're estimating three million dollars in sale this year far we've done two million dollars next year we're estimating about nine million dollars in sales we're going to make this first of all into a billion dollar company and we're doing we're going to disrupt the luggage industry the same way the mattress industry has recently been disrupted and that's why offering a premium product at a significant discount to Consumers luggage of this you're gonna sell everything online all online all this luggage Queen is this revolutionary is different the clever is it worth 28 million nothing's wrong another story you guys know it's a huge ass it's a huge size for that HSN HSN reached out and said but you're pricing that as though it's already now ask me if it's worth 28 Min and I'll tell you no I gotta tell you I think the business is probably worth five to eight million dollars today you put that money in your pocket that's money you made you put that money in your pocket but that's anecdotal it's one-off don't have any track record there would you sell 30 percent of the company to Robert for 1.4 million which reflects his more conservative five million dollar valuation wouldn't you absolutely not I've seen from all the other luggage companies where we're running scared and interested in what we're doing is we can grow this guys good 10 million 20 minutes we have other products nobody silence are you prepared to have flexibility on your 28 million dollar ass all sharks are still in but they question the high valuation of Gaston and Jesse's smart luggage company trunkster prepared to have flexibility on your 28 million dollar ass this reminds me of if I may share a story that in January we're choosing our Factory partner and we weren't able to get there on the but he told me to say this listen he's from Long Island listen somebody's going to manufacture trunks it either it's going to be you or it isn't whoever it is that person's gonna make a lot of money and I can tell you that was true then and it's true now partner is making a lot of money I will say to that we're reasonable we're willing to negotiate we understand this is a business and we want the partners how much of your own cash did you guys put in we spent five thousand dollars to launch the kickstarter campaign yeah that's all the money we invested you haven't shipped anything yet your 5000 is now worth 28 million dollars I'm lucky to be here what an opportunity that's a great return also no we should say something about the product that our product has three things that few products have in combination anymore listen everybody agrees it's interesting and even Lori clean the luggage if I if I could be the exception on the product I find a couple of things wrong one it's Sleek but it's extremely masculine product line experience you're doing others but I'm judging by this prototype secondly I think it's too heavy in addition to the fact that most people soft luggage not hard luggage and lastly you haven't had your consumer base tested out they haven't received it yet you're asking us to invest a lot of money with absolutely no feedback from the guy who's going to use it we have had people testing testers came back with positive reviews and for those reasons there's many unanswered questions but magically the two of you have convinced me that there's something there I'll give you the 1.4 million for 30 percent maybe that's all legitimate offer Mark can laugh all he wants he's not making an offer that's the offer I see because of all the unanswered questions this isn't an investment we're going on a trip together and when we go on this trip together that's what he's saying and I think it's fair in fact I'll join him if he wants a partner I you guys I'll do that deal I'll go 50 50 if he wants to mitigate his risk a little bit Kevin I appreciate the offer I don't want Kevin to go on this trip with me because there are countries Kevin's not allowed to go into I will make the same offer except I want 37 percent as ludicrous as you are your valuation is insane I'm sitting here thinking about losing my money on the one hand I do think that there's a lot of things that can be done with it I have licensing connections I know this world but on the flip side say I give you the money and something goes wrong with it don't anticipate it but it could happen I would give you the 1.4 million to fund purchase orders you want at 15 percent [Music] we would love to hear if Mark maybe has something to say the product's interesting I see what you're trying to accomplish now I want you to put yourself in orange juice how much get back and win we expect to be making six million dollars in profit next we can pay you back next year it's a simple question but I don't want one million absolutely we're aiming to make a billion dollar company you have us working together in your mind there's these big numbers you can pay back but when we do the math based off of the equity you're offering us the numbers don't calculate two big numbers and make 20 million dollars next year what's five percent of 20 million dollars a million dollars you didn't look at it from our perspective gentlemen I always love Mark more than anyone on the panel because he's got the most bucks but let me tell you Lori's the best partner would it be an option to work together or that would negotiate when we take one moment yeah thank you 10 you're comfortable give 10 with two sharks helping us all what are you gonna do Mark and Lori we would to offer you five percent of trunk surf for 1.4 million dollars we will also pay you back the full 1.4 million within 24 months and if we don't pay you back within that time frame we will double your Equity stake 10 percent and we will offer you one dollar in perpetuity starting from when the when the money is paid back all that's your offer Mark Lori what do you got [Music] I would take that deal yeah we'll take that deal hang on Wow [Music] thank you much wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel then for that reason I'm out\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:**

make traveling [Music] easier hello sharks my name is Ryan and I'm the creator of trippy the goto app for navigating big airports I am seeking $100,000 in exchange for 10% equity in my company airports are confusing even for the most frequent business traveler is a college student from Oakland going to school back east at Colgate and a former travel individual basketball player I was always in the airport my typical airport experience always went a little something this I'd have my carry on bags I make my way all the way to my gate then i' want to grab a bite to eat before my long flight but I had no idea which way to turn for food and you and how it is an airport directory is never there when you need it and who wants to travel all the way up and down the terminal and search for something that might not be there in the first place sadly what I have to do a lot of the time is settle for the little new stand by my gate that was Notorious for selling nothing but bottled water and a soggy disgusting tuna fish sandwich little did I know that my favorite Mexican Food Spot was only a 3 minute walk away from my gate with trippy I wouldn't have to settle for this disgusting nasty tuna fish sandwich there goes that basketball career that's why I started trippy I'm sorry instead I'd be able to eat the Sumptuous burrito of my dream yeah trippy takes the guesswork and turbulence out of navigating big airports now let me show you how it works great you're able to select an airport let select start National as you can see you can get a list of all the restaurants L Fish now let's select the Shark Tank Diner all you at the Shark Tank Diner it's only a minute 108 ft away where where deals are made the top dish is the Mr Wonderful special which features extem probably closed by now it went out of business food safety and now you can see where you are currently in the airport and it shows that that little blue dot is your location and it can guide you all the way to your destination with the arrival of trippy means a departure of your airport stress we need your help in order to get trippy in the hands of millions of jet Setters worldwide thank you Ryan how many airports do you have today we had four airports up to this point San Francisco Atlanta Chicago O'Hare and Toronto ever since I graduated 3 weeks ago we EXP expanded now we're in nine airports R are you still trying to finish your burrito yes you go swallow take a minute swallow and then keep how do you keep your information always updated with changes in restaurants particularly menu items pricing now it's strictly the description of exactly what they sell for example if it's a bar will be they sell certain types of beer but it's not as descriptive I'm sorry I still have this burrito that's all you need some water you have some water back there go ahead I don't have water back there embarrassing there you go there you go my gosh thank you thank you Eric embarrassing we got time it's only the biggest moment of your life and you're choking on a burrito but what else could go wrong choking in the presentation else Happ welcome back yeah thank you thank you all Ryan are you a student now yes I recently graduated do you have a job conratulations I turned I turned down a couple jobs opportunities I turned down interviews from Facebook and Google I was my school's Google student Ambassador how do you make money today what do you do for a living now this is all that I do I'm I can't go 2 seconds without thinking about this you live at home and yeah I live at home with my parents thanks who coded it I'm the I'm the sole iOS Developer for this good for you yeah how long ago did you upload it I uploaded it to the to the App Store App Store in October do you have any customers yes now we have only we we have about 850 downloads with 160 monthly active users there are other apps that do this yes similar who cares about the competitors why are you better why we're better is the fact that our main goal is not now trying to be an an airport directory our main goal is to connect air Travelers within the airport a ways of the indoor space being able to connect Travelers where being able to TSA wait time that's completely different that's isn't Google Maps doing a lot of that cuz Google Maps has your destination stuff where it'll track where you walk in the airport yes we we use we using the Google Maps API the thing that differentiates us between us and Google Maps is the fact that we're trying to make a a community of Travelers that are are able to communicate with one another Ryan let me ask you something if if for example you were able to get $100,000 here in the tank what would you do with that money my a priority is to get a developer that's better than me to be able to parse flight itineraries to be able to load them into our application wow and since I graduated monthly active users have jumped by 40% to what how many 169 monthly active that's a throw number understand that it's it's low are you plugged in some a backend system a directory within the airports no we do not and are you adding manually someone goes there and gets his data how are you getting the information I I work with my my brother who helps me with data aggregation from public websites and things exactly from hours reviews all these things and aggregating that into our backend that's tough trying to aggregate that that data essentially manually manually that's hard it is why not tying to the backhand airport systems because we don't have connections in the we I haven't reached out to the airports you said something that I thought was brilliant you said you want to become the ways for airports I personally think if you could the biggest problem ever in airports is not knowing what that Line's going to be when you get there that would be an amazing home run the reason why I didn't come in here pitching that because we don't have that functionality in the application yet I have a lot of ideas to where where to take this application no I totally get that I feel your mind is brilliant and you can get there but for me I to know something's already even in the works I'm sorry I'm out unfortunately I don't have that rich Uncle unfortunately I I can't raise that friends and family around hey Ryan don't say that don't say you don't have that rich unle don't don't say that look my dad worked in a factory my mom was a receptionist you got to deal with the reality of what you have you got to be more Innovative that's the beauty of being an entrepreneur you get to create value and then go with what you have don't look at what you don't have the problem with the app that I see is there's nothing proprietary about it there's no competitive advantage to it but now I haven't had the opportunity to I don't want to quash Your Enthusiasm but I'm out and and I would add to that look you you have smarts you have passion I think that even if you hadn't had a ton of downloads even if You' come and say look guys I have a product I haven't gone out there yet but the product has something proprietary to it I would be open to that my problem is at the moment the money you need is to get to the product that's necessary for that reason I'm All Out R don't don't feel discouraged because there's nothing wrong with you but what we have here is not yet a business we have a confused model it's too early to come in and ask for an investment I'm out our main goal now is to be able to build our user base be able to get our users to be able to use this application do you realize how impossible that is and when I said do you realize how many apps have tried to be ubiquitous they have enough users that the users can crowdsource information and make it work ways have or someone else have look I'm not going to over compliment you I'm not going to build you up cuz I know this hurts and I can see it on your face how bad it hurts we're only in the iOS store we haven't even we haven't even jumped in my mom can't even download the application how many people in Toronto use your airport about about 20 million a year how many people live in San Francisco and use SFO San Francisco who use it about 55 million years what are the other airports Atlanta which is 104 million take those three yes your potential user base is over 200 million people you have 169 monthly active users it's not the number of airports as a application that's in beta a lot of people believe in us when we pitched last year at Colgate when this was an idea we had three for of 30 30 CEOs you're lying to yourself to think that you're going to be differentiated that everybody's going to ignore iOS maps and Google Maps and come to you I'm I'm I get this is hard it's hard to be an entrepreneur I'm saying this to you to try to help the one mistake almost every entrepreneur makes that we have to overcome is we lie to ourselves we tell ourselves that it's a great idea the problem with your idea is it's a feature not a product I hope you get there but I'm [Music] out I wish you the best buddy thank you good luck good luck hold on hold on hold on hold on I

being a being a full-time computer science major a student a a a leader on campus all these things I've been able to do all this in the back of the bus on the after away games when we we're traveling back from DC I'm coding in the airport before four games I'm coding Brian what stop patting yourself in the back and stop feeling sorry for yourself I've spent 36 hours straight coding teaching myself

dollars in exchange for 10 of my company liberate sharks are you ready for the best workout of your life today I'm going to have you working out muscles you forgot existed one second let me get my equipment out [Music] perfect did you think we were working on our physical fitness today no sharks today we're working out our mental muscles liberate is the first mental Fitness Studio our method Blends mindful movement with journaling conversation and meditation for a dynamic workout for your mind our classes and courses Empower individuals and teams to build skills courage gratitude and resilience to strengthen Collective -being sharks it doesn't take heavy lifting to know that we're on to something here who wants to put your money where your mind is and join our mental Fitness movement Liv are you starting a cult or something no not and how the hell do I make money with any of this crap do I go somewhere I live because you have a studio online classes hosted over zoom in May 2020. live were these instructor-led classes yes Bridge per class and what what do you charge a subscription for our on-demand library is 19 a month and the subscription model for and the On Demand is 49 a month and how many subscribers do you have I I want to open up the picture a little bit because the main source of our revenue is our B2B model in 2021 we realized businesses and teams need a lot of help too teams are disconnected they're remote they're struggling to connect on a human level 65 of our business now is through our corporate partnership let me ask what's your total sales total sales is 50 000 lifetime live I don't think anybody here is going to challenge your premise I'm on board 100 what I'm struggling with how is this business worth two million dollars today our margins are over 90 percent we have 178 quarter over quarter growth rate we're 10 exiting the business in the first year and we've built a highly scalable system team and curriculum you only have 50 000 in sales lifetime far I love the optimism how much did you do last month 7 500 last month and we're projecting doing 8 500 this month and we have a sixty nine hundred dollar deal with a corporate partner that's closing distance you're not getting scale live yeah seriously I love I love everything about what you're doing but there are big companies doing similar stuff and they're charging us fifty a hundred thousand dollars why aren't you getting that scale is it because you don't stand the B2B Market or the consumer Market isn't working for you why isn't there more our corporate program is only six months old and we also with investment to hire a sales manager to help invest in scaling it's still hard I think his point though is pricing more than anything else I can raise the prices yeah and you might have to look I believe in mental Clarity the Dallas Mavericks have had a full-time team psychologist because if you can't perform mentally you can't perform physically the challenge is how do you scale to Robert's point and I learned this a long time ago sell at a premium don't sell out of desperation because selling five thousand dollar deals is no easier than selling fifty or a hundred thousand dollar deals yeah you've got to get to that point where you have enough confidence because it's you're on you're on Trend you're on need you're on value but you're underpricing yourself and because of that it's impossible for an investor to come in because it's impossible to scale with where you're at for those reasons amount I'd to talk to another point of how scale let me pick up on that because I I know that you're following a similar Trend though you're early in your journey you're you're it's a good time to join it is a good time to join it's not a good time to join at a two million valuation I love what you're doing we are to be the soul cycle of mindfulness we're licensing out our curriculum we have a hundred variations of proprietary curriculum that can be licensed out to every Fitness and Studio every Fitness maybe but you haven't done any of those things today to show me a tangible return it's an early stage flexible it is unbelievably important to me to partner with a shark that is my goal I am hard working and driven I I can't leave this carpet without a deal it's my purpose on Earth is to build liberate I would love to have your support on that journey I think you need to go through a journey to learn more before I can come with you I'm out my thought is that I love what you're doing we all know that the mind is the largest muscle on the body and as soon as that thing expands it never shrinks never goes back but you haven't figured it out yet a little too early I love what you're doing but I'm out thank you Kevin Glory live [Music] every day you have a wellness portfolio that's ripe and perfect you're and you've done your homework you're wonderful you have energy and you have grit any deal on the planet I I know I know you are I know you are the now you are at a stage where you're figuring out what you're doing this is where you you invest in the entrepreneur and then the idea grows a tree you don't have it realized fully enough yet for me and for that I'm out thank you Lori royalties wow wow good for you this idea is without marriage it's going to zero you will never make any money God you will never get an investor take it behind the barn and shoot it and do something else thank you Kevin good luck Liv congratulations you have to go now do I leave [Music] believing in what I was

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] Whoa. , first off, you guys are looking beautiful. Thank you. , my name is Zach. I invented this thing called a Freaker and I'm here today looking for a $200,000 investment in exchange for a 10% equity in my company Freaker USA. this is a Freaker. We have over 35 designs. We add characters and personalities to all of them. The Freaker's function is that it has magical fibers in it that make it stretch they can fit every beverage in the world. you can put it on your morning beer if you wanted to. [Music] All . And the freaker will fit every water bottle in the world. That is pretty crazy. Every water bottle. For my last trick, I'm going to put this little tiny freaker on this huge wine bottle. As you can see, there are no wires attached. there's nothing up my sleeves. Nothing in my beard. Damon, you want to check my beard? Make sure you're good. All . Can I get a whoop? Robert, I love you. Love you, man. All . , without any further ado, I have a little video to show you guys more about it. Hope you enjoy. Here we go. This is the birth of Freaker USA. Living in a car, traveling, found a new home in Wilmington, North Carolina. Invited to a stitching Learned to need a beer kuzooie. Horrible knitter but wanted to give them to all my friends. Found all sweaters. Cut them up. Sewed them into beer koozies. Started feeling bad about destroying too many sexy sweaters. Ate pancakes. Felt better. Found a small mom and pop mill in Troy, North Carolina. Communicated through song and dance. Yay. They programmed robots to spit out freakers. Formed a team. Launched a website. Made a bunch of crazy marketing videos. Battle Gandalf. Dancing a fire hydrant. Turn a box truck into a house. Drove around the country throwing grilled cheese parties. Blew up some trade shows. Went on Shark Tank. Got a huge investment for a small equity share. Stopped all bottles sweat and moist handshakes in the world. Yay. I'm freaking excited. Can I get a whoop? You're a strange cat. . , I've got I've got some freakers for you guys before I forget. Here we go. Awesome. Zach, is this the actual package? , this is the package. This these are the first freakers that are packaged this way. , thanks, Zach. Yeah. Now, Zach, I hate to bring it down to money, but I always do. What do you got? 200,000 for 10% is telling me that you think your freaker business is worth $2 million. Now, I'm a believer. I'm a believer, baby. Make you believe. , why don't you tell me what your sales are in the last year? In the last year, we've only been out for 13 months. , we're about 320,000. Whoa. , you're not crazy. You're making money. Where are the sell where are you selling them? , we have them in about 200 stores. We've got a Japanese distributor, a Canadian distributor. , this is not a new new idea. Why is it doing ? It is a new idea on the concept that it's one drink insulator that'll stretch and fit everything. No, I've seen it in Lycra and spandex. We have a patent on it. It issued. Yes. What's your cost per freaker? about a dollar. A little under a dollar. And what's your wholesale cost? wholesale starts at four and suggested retails 8 to10. Zach, I got one more question. -huh. Why do you keep making those noises? Cuz it's cool. , Zach, I get the whole lifestyle thing. I buy into that. It's a brand builder. I love it all. Now, let's talk about what your business is worth. Let's say you're going to do 320,000 in the last over 11 months, you said, ? , yes. , let's annualize that. You're making about 15% to the bottom line before you pay tax approximately. . You're worth somewhere between 350 and 400,000 bucks. That's it. . , I think I need 50%. That would be a reasonable valuation. Yeah. What do you say to that? , I'd probably make some beeps at you. And I'm saying while we're beeping. Yeah. Yeah. , I I wouldn't I wouldn't entertain it. Seriously. , Zach. Baby. Beep beep beep. I'm out. , cool. Another cool thing that we didn't touch on on the video, there was a box truck that we turned into a house. We drove around the country throwing grilled cheese parties. It's one of our forms of marketing. But isn't that the challenge, ? I I think it's cool. You can go around to all the festivals. You guys can set up at Not festivals. You don't go to festivals at all? Not now. I don't festivals now. . Even though you don't festivals? No. No. You seem perfect for festivals. I seem that way. Yeah. I'm not I'm not much of a festival guy. ? No. What do you do when you're off time? I get up early. Usually go to the river, walk dogs. Let me tell you how you value the company. It's nutsy. On that basis alone, although I love you, I'm out. . I love you too, Barbara. I love you too. I get the entire brand. Yeah. But there's no beeping way you're worth $2 million today. , , there obviously I feel there must be some missing on your guys' part of where I'm at if you're not getting even close to that. Look, I you, Zach, but , it's it it's it's I can promise you you'd be into it. I I could say in 6 months you're going to be , \", Zach, what? I got to be honest with you. And I'm not up here. I'm dressed you and hang out and dancing everywhere. We could have some umbrella drinks. We kick it back. Holler at some girls. I'm out. All , Robert. [Music] , Zach, , , I have to be passionate about everything I invest in. Yeah. And I'm not feeling that way about this. I'm out. . All . You got some words of wisdom? , the reality is your margin's great. The opportunity for branding and putting a Mavs logo or whatever logo, the incremental cost is probably minimal. , there's some unique opportunities there. But if I had to listen toep, hey, Markep, what's up? Beep beep. I'd shoot myself. I'm out. Now, we need to hear the beeping of you backing up. All . Love you guys.

happens I my factory wasn't big enough to make the straps fast enough to meet their orders I allowed the company that I went with to make the straps for me we launched we went out on Home Depot's shelves but they got carried away they made them too fast and you tie your motorcycle down that and they would slip boy my God they all came back they all came back I made the teeth inside this piece roll the strap the harder it would pull the the more it would dig into the strap when they redesigned it they decided to make the teeth redesigned it in China the factory in China you went 1.9 million because I didn't do the purchase order they did they went in the hole wait Home Depot or the person you the person I partnered with yes you were still involved or did you step away completely and say send me my commission check I waited for my royalty checks to come and you left it to them completely and they SC who cares about this how many got sold before they got recalled I don't have that

And that's when I first started to realize as soon as you start to focus your mind and your heart and your spirit and your soul on your passions, the universe starts to open up doors and unlock windows you never thought possible. And the p and I started to learn the power of this word because it's intuitive and instantly personal to people. When people around the world hear be somebody, it becomes about you and about what you love, becomes about your personal passion, whether it's photography or car racing or fashion, that's what's powerful about it. And as soon as I started to see that there was something there, I got a chance to leave PNG and go lead social marketing at GoPro for working for somebody next. You're doing a lot of talking and you're not getting anywhere now, ? What's the end product? What am I Let me show you guys. , we built an iOS app. This is my profile. You see all your profiles here. , this is my profile page. If you hit that little plus, it opens up all my passions. You can add as many as you want. You can create them and then our algorithm takes everything you're passionate about. Then shows you experiences around you in your local area. It's an experience marketplace. Think about Airbnb. When you're booking houses here, you can book an experience and then you can book individual training. What's great question? We take 20% of every experience that's booked on our platform. On average, $40 an experience. You have to aggregate a whole bunch of passionaries. By the way, I love your name, Cash. Thank you. But unfortunately, I've learned that happiness can't buy money. , I've got to understand how fast you can scale this thing I can make cash. . , what we have, we have a global movement that reaches 5 million people. That means 5 million people a month are either dropping this be somebody hashtag. If you guys search it now, get out, get on your phone, search that, but is that of your company or in general be somebody? I trade I was the first person in history. If you put in hashtag and B, it'll pop up and someone could still click on it. it doesn't mean necessarily. We own every asset with be somebody. That's fine. it's GoPro we we branded the the fisheye. Trying to see what connects to revenue. I'm a little confused what the platform is. Is the idea we get together and do an activity we white water rafting or is it a training platform where I go to an expert whitewater rafting person? Great question. I wanted to get back to the scale question. I think that's important. The number one way we found a scale is through strategic partnerships. You guys heard from Christine Lily. How do you protect yourself against Barbara and I, we go white water rafting, a big jagged rock comes up, somebody pushes her off the boat, she cracks her head to the white meat. Before her husband gets a brand new sexy wife, he sues somebody. How do you protect yourself against lawsuits that? now, we haven't had that problem. We know we're have to figure out if you had that problem. I think that's the reason we're raising capital, , because we need somebody lose it in a law to insure yourself. Do you have a disclaimer? , what happened? , how long have you been offering experience? 12 months in Austin, Texas in 2015. 12 months as a beta, you said. Yeah. are you open to everybody yet? Yeah. At the end of 2015, we decided we're going to our focus is scale. the first six months of 2016, we've been closing partnerships. $80,000. How many How many experiences did you book last month? Probably about $2,000. . again, we have building a global your answer to the potential litigation was you're raising capital. Is that to get a big insurance policy? , how Every passionary that hosts a fitness or outdoor experience has to have liability insurance on their own. It's part of our terms with the strategic partnerships when we scale. The reason why they're partnering with us, there's three reasons. One, because they believe in the mission. You heard Christine Lily. Two, because they have a shared traffic. Why would she give you exclusivity when you have nobody on this? Because you probably had to qualify the exclusivity to an app or something specific as opposed to all bookings, ? We know all bookings. 100% bookings. All the 100% of their revenue is dependent on you, ? Listen, you guarantee her any minimums? No, we didn't. We didn't. , but but you got to understand people. She's going to starve. She's begging for Mark. No, because even he's running out of cash up here. One second. to finish here, we become a payment platform and a tool for them. But I think the guys, what's the most important part about this is people believe in what we stand for. I'm going to show you guys one thing real quick. my god. , I think I think it's important. I I used to carry this around back in 2011. A little 8 by11 car that I met myself when I was going around the world to try to inspire people. You're killing us. Did you bring a collection plate? All six sharks are still in. But Mark has an issue with Cash selling the passion more than the merits of his business. Be Somebody, a booking platform for experiences. Cash. Rule number one, the longer the backstory, the worse the deal. , , let me tell you about our business. More preaching always equals less money for the investor. For those two reasons, I'm out. . I find you enormously abrasive. You drive me nuts. I feel as though you don't have the capacity to listen. Could you imagine what a partner you would make for me? I'm out. . Cash. Here's the beauty of a social platform. Here's the beauty of a movement. A movement by nature is viral, ? You're not getting that growth. No, it's working. what? It's working. We don't we don't have passionaries yet because we haven't we haven't scaled our marketplace. , my BS and I'm not calling you out on this. I'm saying my my sense for that always goes up. I I don't understand the business, ? , I'm out. I'm going to jump in. , there's many apps out there. It seems to me this is not going to be one that's going to make it. I'm out. Cash. How much How much of your own money do you have in this? $200,000. Wow. $200,000. You're pioneering experiential learning. No, you're not. Education is a $4.1 trillion industry. Online learning is going three times as fast. Preach. Preach. Important. It's important. I still never got over how you're going to protect yourself against liabilities. I think you're going to have a lot of people teaching dangerous things and one lawsuit can kill the entire company. I'm out. Let's leave all the passion and all this the kumbaya kumbaya. Leave it aside for a second. In the end, Shark Tank's about making money. We built a brand. Kevin, I'm going to put you. what's going to screw you up, Cash? The fact that you're believing your own nonsense. You got to do the work. Beat somebody doesn't get done, bro. You got to do What do you think I've been doing for for three years talking? No, we haven't. We built a community from this. He's an instructor. We built a passionate community. Go online. search be somebody. You're going to get inspired by all the stories that you hear. The people that are here, they're inspired by the movement to have an opportunity. Cash. Silence. We're going to own the experience. I'm calling you out. In eight years of history, you're one of the first people to ever have six shots at this. . You struck out on everyone. Zero. I'm out. See you, buddy. Go be somebody, bro.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 10%, 20%, 100%, the 100% (PERCENT), first, second (ORDINAL), World Cup, Olympic (EVENT), Tide (PRODUCT), Austin, Texas (GPE)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, an experience, christine lily, the world, a lot, your passions, experiential learning, our platform\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 call: one\n  \u2022 call: myself\n  \u2022 seek: 1 million\n  \u2022 build: experience marketplace\n  \u2022 learn: anything\n  \u2022 book: experience\n  \u2022 book: group experience\n  \u2022 book: soccer experience\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 thank: guys\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.19)\n\n**Topics:** experience, people, cash, platform, passion",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nfirst into the tank is a product to ensure you always know who's at your front door [Music] who's there it's jamie here to pitch who it's jamie come in [Music] sharks wouldn't have been nice to know who was behind the door before you let me in with my product you can my name is jamie siminoff i'm from los angeles california my product is the doorbot i'm seeking 700 000 for a 10 stake in the company consumers are currently spending billions of dollars outfitting their homes with products that work with smartphones however one of the most ubiquitous technologies the doorbell has not changed since it was invented in 1880 until now introducing the doorbot the first ever video doorbell built for the smartphone with doorbot you can see and speak with visitors from anywhere but i didn't invent doorbot to make our lives more convenient it also adds needed security let me show you mark let's say this is your house in dallas you'll see on the screen here that i'm projecting the doorbell app for my smartphone to make it easier to see the demo now a regular call when someone rings the doorbot you can see them and decline if it's a someone that you don't want to talk to or accept and say hello to your visitor think of it as caller id for your front door [Music] hey good looking doorbot guy hey mark it's your good friend mr wonderful i wanted to have you join me on this deal with doorbot i think we can get them to go all royalties and no equity mark we know that no real entrepreneur's gonna accept that deal and now you can tell mr wonderful to scram and the best thing is you can do it without having to be face to face with him now sharks join me and the next time you hear it'll be now who wants me first to ring my bell jamie what if you hit accept you hit accept then the light goes blue and then you can talk to them your voice comes out of it your voice comes out of it it's got a microphone and speaker it's two-way audio one-way video if someone came up and said eyeball there can they take it off because all burglars ring the doorbell first what though mark that's true burglars are not usually violent criminals they want to see if someone's home they want the opportunity to go into a house that's not that does not have people in it it's true people do ring the doorbell it's hard to remove and we also have offered that any customer that has one stolen we will replace it for free of charge and how much does each one of these units sell for 199 what are your costs to make it 81.83 is our cost landed in our warehouse in the united states and you sell it to retailers far we've only sold direct on our own online store we are launching with our first retailer in november which is staples we launched nine months ago we've done an aggregate a million dollars in sales far good for you and you've done a million dollars far wow and the last month we've done 250 000 in sales our sales have grown month over month all online jamie all online all direct do you have any competitors currently we do not have any direct competitors when i say direct we're the first video doorbell built for the smartphone now there are other video doorbells out there that go to a panel it's not two-way you don't have communication from that you can see who's there competition costs the lowest price camera would be 50 to 100 up to thousands of dollars for many systems but we're not trying to compete with the hundred thousand dollar systems that integrate cameras and everything in your home that's that that means a totally different market what we're trying to do is disrupt that market to give that to everybody the norm to give it to my wife who's at home who's in the bedroom with my five-year-old i'm away and at eight o'clock at night and it's dark out someone knocks on the door i the product but are there bigger solutions that can come in and push this out the door this category will exist the doorbell will stay there it doesn't get trumped by technology i'm going to drive that there's a thousand different ways to alert what business is not going to get replaced by future technology but they're here it's about being able to be nimble and be part of that change i'm going gonna jump in here i think that you have potential to do a lot more with this but i'm not connecting to that this does enough at this time to distinguish itself is different from what else is out there on the market for the higher price point and for that reason i'm up we're not comparing ourselves to a a cheap video doorbell that has a little tiny no one's arguing the quality of the product i it i think you're going to do great with it but i've got to be able to say what when i jump in i've got to add enough value that this company still being worth 7 million could be worth 80 million 90 million i don't see that progression and for that reason i'm out when i when i look at businesses i look at the three tiers that could hit luxury mid tier and lower tier obviously we understand the luxury market where we have the 20 and 30 thousand dollar systems and all that type of stuff that's not for that the mid tier is the adt's of the world that most likely will add this to their services in some sense i i'm wrestling with where this goes in the market i don't think it's for me i'm out personally i'm a security guy the idea of having another access point on my house that freaks me out a little bit because all those adt and all those other ones are hardwired i can't hack into those i think you've priced a lot of value into it but i think my real struggle with is it's not an internet play it's a consumer device but you're pricing out 199 that that price point is going to start dropping quickly as your volumes go up for that reason that matters [Music] sorry about that don't send them to my house it's it's you and you now jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i gonna regret that mr wonderful [Music] four sharks are out kevin is jamie's last chance at a deal jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i going to regret that mr wonderful the only person left is mr wonderful i'll make you an offer i'll give you seven hundred thousand dollars i want a ten percent royalty that drops down to seven after i recoup the seven hundred thousand and i get five percent of the company's equity today we we have a vision i think to build a a big company out of this and i can't give someone 10 of all of our sales because it'll bleed us of cash while we need it the most i'm providing you factoring capital you need my 700 000 for inventory but but respectfully i can raise that money through venture debt or line of credit or something else then what's not the why don't you counter me with a venture dead off i would do seven hundred thousand dollars for a ten percent interest rate with a three percent equity kicker no not interested that doesn't it that doesn't it's not commensurate with the risk i'm taking honestly i do appreciate the offer but at the same time that money that you'd be taking on the royalty i need to reinvest back in this business what's the difference between the interest and the royalty the interest is cheaper the interest i can get rid of i can pay you back you don't the the royalty in perpetuity absolutely but i took the risk up front i believed in you the only shark i might add that did 700 000 is a lot of money it is a lot of money absolutely it's a lot of money jamie it's that moment when i say you're dead to me because you don't want to take my offer i made you a valid offer i think under the circumstances respectfully mr wonderful we're going to decline go kick some ass jimmy thank you much yeah good luck sharks kevin he was hi he was wavering there was a moment where he considered it i would have done that to you whatever happened to peeking through the window and saying go away mr wonderful gave us an offer for royalties on the company and i don't believe you can build a big company having one person take 10 of the sales for life you\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** first (ORDINAL), jamie siminoff, jamie, kevin, jimmy (PERSON), los angeles, california, dallas,

with snow I have the perfect solution with snow in seconds we bring the magic of snow indoors it's easy take one small scoop of our powder add water and watch as it instantly grows into fluffy white snow it looks and feels real but never melts with snow in seconds you can bring the joy of snow anywhere snow in seconds is cold to the touch safe and realistic it's used in movies we're on the edge of an avalanche of opportunity who's Yeti to ride with me in a chairlift up to the peak of profits don't give me the cold shoulder let's make this winter wonderland Global and make every day a snow day nice W it falls snow it's a Christmas miracle my eighth grade teacher had dandruff this e how did she come up with the idea we stumbled across this chemical it's mostly used for industrial use about 99% of it is used for agriculture they put it in soil that it holds the water and can grow and when it grows it grows quickly which is exciting what is it essentially made out of it's one chemical it's called sodium poly acrylyl-coa [Music] a small amount this or you can make a giant pile and have a huge party or even a sledding hill it feels powdery and soft then you feel that it's a little wet I'm going to assume that there is absolutely nothing proprietary about this product that is true but we have tried dozens of different manufacturers out there most of them turn into a gel and they don't grow fast why can't I go to your manufacturer with wond snow I do it myself we've been selling it for 15 years we have our our own brand you selling 15 years that could be problematic how's it how's that problematic cuz he's here after 15 years yeah but what are your Sals in the 15 years in 15 years out of our one stall garage with my children and I packaging and shipping every single bag we have sold $2 million wow I didn't expect that he not how much how much did you sell last year yeah last year we sold about A4 million 241,000 and how much did you make from that $4,000

make there's a lot of margin there is there any retail distribution at all we were in Kroger and Fred Meyer about 1,500 stores it went great they reordered a little more the next year and then at that time I was going to through a divorce and my my business partner was running the company and at that point he had outsourced the entire production of it to someone else and we missed the shipment on that third year painful to hear eventually they sent it all back they didn't even accept it cuz it was a month late it came too late yeah how did you get into doing this in the first place I am an

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\n[Music] next up are entrepreneurs who believe their product is cooler than the [Music] rest what's up sharks I'm Dave and I'm Joe and we're the twins that founded CEST we started this company in Naples Florida and sharks it gets hot out there and we wanted to create the coldest things to help you stay colder longer how cold Dave this much colder my God we embarked on a journey to create the coldest products ever this is our water bottle we tested this bottle against 50 plus of the largest hydration Brands out there and designed it to stay cold for up to 36 plus hours long with thoughtful design features such as this non-slip rubber bottom it's 100% link proof and we're not a hydration company we wanted to create the coldest everything store we designed and developed the coldest pillow because I was sick and tired of sleeping sweaty at night we also designed and developed the coldest dog bed and the coldest dog bowl because dogs to sleep cold too we're seeking $600,000 for 2% equity in our business what do you say Shark ice who wants to get bured in an avalanche of cash and join us on expanding the universe of cold my God my gosh wow what do we got here yes what do we have that's a limitless series it comes with three lids that are fully insulated and it stays cold 36 plus hours tell us about you guys it sounds an interesting story my parents are both immigrants my dad's from Jordan and my mom's from the Philippines they're both engineers and all our entire life we thought engineering was the only route to go into they tricked you huh they tricked us and every day I'd listen to business podcast cuz me and Joe we've always been obsessed with business our entire life I had these side hustles they were software businesses building websites for other clients we knew how to build brands but all of our side hustles they kept on failing but every single one of them we've learned a cool lesson along the way and then 2015 came and that's when cold is begun and I had $14,000 saved up it was all my money and I put it into the coldest the coldest water was what it was initially called I finally chose a factory I sent them the money all 14,000 it was 4,000 water bottles and my older brother looks at me and he's do you think you're going to sell 1,000 water bottles how competitive that market is and I looked at him you're and I message to the factory I'm we need to cancel that order and she responds back in a few minutes we can't cancel the order it's too late your orders already on the factory line then I two years later we're doing about 900k in Revenue what happened with the ,000 you casually threw that out there let we'll get into the number shortly yeah but but what happened to that order that one bottles they sold out they sold out sold out and how long how Peri you're horrible pictures in what period of time did that sell out I would say it was probably within the first 5 months we initially started on Amazon we were pure Amazon Play digital e-commerce D Toc company in 2017 I said let's start up an alliance you create the best coldest product and I'll work focusing on the marketing and within a year it was about 2018 now we had hit 1 to3 million in sales when we're getting the numbers here cuz this is the part you asked for 600,000 that's not chump change give us year-by-year Revenue 2017 we did 900k and then 2018 we did 2.5 mil W 2019 is 5.9 2020 we hit 9.3 million wa start to scale nicely and then 2021 was 12.4 Million W it kept on growing and last year last year we hit 15.1 million I've got to ask why are you here what were your profits last year are you making any money on it hold on last year was 400k you lost 400,000 why our inventory it keeps flying out out of the the warehouse it sells fast and we keep buying a lot too we keep buying a lot more we're adding more colors more skews obviously as you can see we're adding more categories as all of our money since day one has been going back into the brand what is your inventory worth now yeah it's around $2.5 million inventory how many SK is that there's over 350 skews in how many of those SKS are over a year old and probably not going to sell I know this sounds weird but all of our stuff moves it's a matter of when we want to discount it and break even at that product and that is 2.5 retail or 2.5 meaning your cost is cost cost and at cost what is the average margin on here how much does the bottle cost to to make and how much you sell it for that specific product retails for $55.99 and we get it for around $10 to1 landed what do you think you're on track to do this year we're on track to do 22 million up to that's on the lowest end lost money last year why is it worth $30 million it's worth that because our growth has been scaling tremendously but the problem is is you're not making money I the way that I see this honestly you had a clever idea but it's almost you fall in love with the sales that you get caught in that cycle of and let's get more and let's do more and let's bring in more and the problem is you're heavily inventoried that you said yourself you're going to sell it off to break even a business should run where you're lean and mean for me it's not a model I I'm sorry I'm out thank you for your feedback La DAV what percentage of your sales do you spend on Advertising a lot last year we did almost 3.3 million in advertising wow guys you guys are a marketing company but in order to be a great marketing company there's got to be science behind it there's got to be more than let me try some ads on Amazon because while I get that you're trying to scale if you want to scale to be a household name you've got to be the best at analytics for advertising I don't see that from you guys I'm out look you've got the growth you started a business from zero you're going to do 20 million that's incredible but I still don't understand why you're losing money it was definitely cold it wasn't hot I'm out why do you believe that the the inventory is a plus because one of the biggest things that slowed FUBU down was when we were doing 400 million a year with broken boxes broken sizes styles that people don't it starts to add up and that is your profit you're headed down a road that I do not want to join you on I think is a dangerous road be careful I'm out we're willing to go up to 10% Equity I thought your presentation absolutely sucked until I heard the sales yeah and that because to me it was another water bottle guy please I've seen many water bottle guys the challenge is return of capital on your deal because you're not worth 30 million bucks I definitely have to have a royalty on this to get my capital capit back and you can get a little better at how you're spending here's the deal I want 7% Equity I give you the $600,000 I want $2.25 in order until I make back 3 million on the 600 then the royalty goes away and I ride the pony on the 7% we're not super interested into a royalty deal but what we would be interested you should get super interested cuz it's the only offer you have now yeah what if we what if we offer this Conor if we pay you back 1.5x of what you're offering say 600k we'll give you 900k in three 3 to 5 years that's uninteresting it's a guaranteed payback what I fell asleep on that one you're going to make 50% more than what you're investing today where else guys I put up 600,000 I can't buy a watch with what they're offering me that's no good I'd rather take the 600 and buy a watch now you have to think in terms of how many watches can I get out of your dat that's what I'm thinking about what's wrong with my offer it's reasonable the 7% for 600 it's definitely on the low end long think of the opportunity here for your brand he has the coldest heart of any human being I have total respect for what you've done in growing Revenue that's impressive there's a lot of fine-tuning you can do to make that more profitable I'm not sure you're doing the best job in terms of digital spend now the only guy you have left is Mr Wonderful last offer 5% equity 225 in order till I get back $3 million and then I ride the equity with you what do you want to do we'd to counter yeah for 1.5 million for 5% equity and at the three-year Mark if you wanted to get out you could give us the equity back and we would pay you out at one and a half times they're getting cold I'm falling asleep again that's not the offer I made Kevin we don't the royalty deals yeah we don't the yeah they need all the cash they can get we got to figure out what makes sense for the brand what makes sense for the brand is me giving you 600,000 are the terms I dictated I think our answer to that is no for\n\nNLP

I this is what are you going to do Kevin you must stop this there is no hope this is a bad idea coolers why I I don't even buy the sustainability thing there's all kinds of plastic in this thing I hate it I'm out guys look first of all your presentation sucked the next time you sell it sell it don't make it worse stick to your features and what sets you apart people truly understand it quickly I think you got a shot it does everything is advertised but for those reasons all you are clinically insane if you're giving these guys reason to go on I do not doubt that you care about the environment about that stuff but your product has to be your protagonist your product has to be your hero and he has to stand on its own merits the social Mission can never be your crotch the social Mission can never be what you go to for a life not a crutch it's our mission it's is our mission it's the reason we're committed to doing this serious we knew that we had done the math we could have been millionaires in our early 30s that's not what we wanted to do we wanted to make a difference in the world and this is our way to do it good yeah no one question Brian that doesn't make any sense it does it doesn't the reason it's not because we want to make a difference it's also because we want to learn and we're in Google we're at Google and apple we had great jobs and we're thinking to ourselves every night when we come home we're not learning enough we're here at the at the office and we're doing the tasks that are being sent our way but but we're not learning enough it wasn't about making a difference it's about learning might you might be the nicest guy in the world but your story has many lapses of credibility for me who's your competitor it's ice come on we know there's a lot of comp competition in the cooler Market we're not shying away from that not at all the problem to solve the story then the story pivots of sustainability and your product is made of plastic and plastic that's me last forever and it's ful come on I throw this this product then you don't have to buy the bag of ice and then that's not the story it's about learning something I wasn't learning enough at Apple and Google look putting all that aside it was a bad presentation it was a bad presentation I'm out appreciate that thank you Robert I think it's going to be important for you to get the cost down yep people when it's affordable enough they're going to buy in and I think that you have a shot what for me to invest it's not what I'm interested in investing in I'm sorry I'm out appreciate that thank you then there's Daniel I'm not 100% confident this is a huge business but I'm confident that if you continue pursuing your dreams you're going to figure it out I wish you the best I personally am out congrats on what you've accomplished good luck guys the golden ticket goes to my favorite product I've made you good offer that's what I'm talking about that is the winner riding all the way to the bankage you've come to the placeNext into the tank is a modern version of a stale car accessory. [Music] Hey Sharks, I'm Trey Brown. And I'm Don Brown. We're two brothers from Los Angeles seeking a $200,000 investment for 5% of our company. Imagine a peaceful day on the road, wind blowing, sunshining. You're bumping your favorite track, cruising down the back streets, catching a vibe. But then that smell hits you. A nearby landfill, spilled coffee, even forgotten French fries can turn your car from an oasis into a horrible, stinky nightmare. For years, the problem of a stinky ride has been solved by a series of ugly and unstylish air fresheners. , we created Ride Fresh, the world's flyest air freshener brand. I know you guys are probably wondering why paper air fresheners. When you do a little sniffing around, you'll figure out that it's an untapped market. At Ride Fresh, we offer a subscription-based car air freshener brand with unique scents and designs that'll be sure to blow you and your customers minds. We have amazing scents wood grain. Wow. Eucalyptus. I love this one, bro. Nice. And even your favorite basketball teams. This one smells winning. Sorry, Mark. The reality is is that paper air freshers have had no innovation in far too long and they smell whack. Hey bro, what's up? I think I'm smelling the deal. With the help of the sharks, we can make ride fresh explode. God sharks in front of you, you'll find a series of our ride fresh scents. Please feel free to crack them open and enjoy. Wow. Wow. After that, we can't even Mark, are you ? You're still over there. , what? Dumbest marketing move ever. I'm out. What? That's it. That's seriously, you got to read the room. Wrong move, wrong time. What are you upset about? Yeah. Why? What do you think? The one air pressure from the NBA is the team that beats us in the NBA conference finals. Got to know that that could that could back man. Cut it out. Yeah, I could be, but I'm not. Wow. Here's one thing I'll shout out. Before I even opened them, I picked them up and I could smell the scents. I was , \"Wow, these are obviously packed with the fragrance.\" , we pride ourselves on having some traditional scents, some non-traditional scents, but our entire approach and our entire brand is adding a cool factor to the air freshener and changing the experience. You sell any of this stuff in retail or is it all subscription direct to consumer online? , we built our business off of direct to consumer online. We proved the concept to the tune of over $1.1 million in sales. and then Thank you. Thank you. What period of time did you in three years? . Let's talk about one year this year. What are you going to do in this year in sales? This year we're going to do over $750,000. But to answer your original question, Mr. Wonderful. We've always known that the subscription was the first phase of our building our business, but the main potential and the biggest potential for us is in retail and wholesale, ? Why would you say that? Have you proven that or have you started down that alleyway? , gas stations, things that, things where it's intuitive to pick this up. Exactly. , in the in the last 6 months, we've been able to get to the final stages of an agreement with the largest automotive retailer in the country. What's the deal for? 2,000 stores, 2,000 of their 6,000 locations. In other words, they're going to order from you how many dollars of merchandise? $2.1 million in in 2023. , it's Pep Boys, that thing. Yeah, it's AutoZone. What did you sell last year? Last year, we sold $540,000 in and out of that 540 was any retail, was it all subscription? All subscription. All Why does somebody buy a subscription model for an air freshener for their car? . Yeah. , it's a convenience factor, ? Think ride share drivers, taxi drivers, these types of individuals. If I started with you, how long before I cancel? About 4 months. And how much is the subscription? , they range. , the base one is you get two a month. we have them in pairs. , and that's $8.25 with shipping. , and then the highest one. Yeah. And the highest one is $10.99. , 38 cents is our cost landed. Out of the 540,000 you did last year. . Were you profitable? Yes. Yes. What did you make? 40,000 in profit. Wow. 40,000. What were you guys doing before this? What got you here? We're we're brothers. we we're lifelong entrepreneurs. in 2014, we launched the first mobile app for black and brown emojis before they diversified the set. My brother has a successful career in sales and I was at a couple different ad agencies in my career. Yeah, we both went to Howard University, the Howard University. I then came to Los Angeles and then I got my masters at USC in entrepreneurship innovation and as as a certified in technology commercialization. I remember walking down the street and seeing all these air freshers everywhere in everybody's car and I was listen if we put some culture and style on top of this thing I already know that this market is 11 billion worldwide and United States is 300 million. yeah we could definitely do this because there's nobody doing a subscription model. That's the most interesting thing you've said in this pitch. The air freshener market is 300 million. That's interesting. I know a lot about fragrance. This is male skewed. I think you need work here in that. I think you need to have an entire femalebased line cuz I I wouldn't hang this shape in my car. It's not the investment for me. But I wish you good luck. Thank you. Thank you much. I'm out. You guys are the real deal. I've been trying to get my head around investing in you. When I was younger, my mom and dad put me in the back of a car with a million suitcases and everything. I had to sit in the back for 24 hours because my dad refused to pay for a motel. , we had to drive from Toronto all the way to Florida. All I could see was the air freshener. It is scorched into my brain. As soon as I see air fresheners, I think I never want to go back there. I'm sorry. I can't be in. I'm out. Fair enough. But let me tell you where I'm stuck at the numbers. . No one's brought this up yet, and I don't know why. $200,000 for 5% imputes a 4 million valuation on a business that makes no money. This is a business model not yet fine-tuned. I'm out. Thank you. I think you need to be congratulated for producing $700,000 in sales online. Amazing. Why you pivoting that you're going into retail? I think you're out of your mind. I don't think you realize how cash intensive it is. Why did you pivot to retail? I'm curious. Because that was all that was always the plan, ? And in the last year, the main way that we were able to grow the subscriptions and acquire those subscribers became a lot more expensive. You were losing hard in your subscription model because the numbers had changed. Yes, but we were always going to focus on growing the business through retail and wholesale. All . , I'm going to make you an offer contingent on your big deals. . . I'll take a flyer on this because I believe in the two of you. , I'll make you the offer of, of course, the 200,000, but I do want 25% of the business. Wa, that smells a lot. Let me Can I ask a question? Yes, of course. , are there other ways that you can help us in terms of a strategic partnership , in exchange for maybe 15% for the 200k? I would have to say 15% definitely not. I think this is going to be a lot of work to sell this. Thinking about 200k for 20 what? For 20%. Contingent on those two big deals. Conting on those two deals. You got it. . Good one, guys. Thank you. Thank you. You better not lose my money. Thank you much. My pleasure. ? Thank you. You did a great job. And sorry again. My weakness. Sorry. It's all good. It's all good. Congrats, guys. Nice job. I think Barber saw true entrepreneurs, grit, grind, tenacity. We were already trending upwards with these major retail and wholesale deals that trade been able to secure. And having Barber on board means that we're going to have more resources and more abilities to scale this business all the way to the top.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** last night, 24 hours (TIME), first (ORDINAL), Los Angeles, United States, Toronto, Florida (GPE), French (NORP)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the chiller, this thing, a time, a lot, the world, your product, a difference, you guys\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 load: drinks\n  \u2022 offer: solution\n  \u2022 put: this\n  \u2022 do: tasks\n  \u2022 send: way\n  \u2022 be: lot\n  \u2022 wish: best\n  \u2022 imagine: day\n  \u2022 bump: track\n  \u2022 hit: you\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.11)\n\n**Topics:** air, thing, year, time, guy",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nNext into the tank is a platform to help you explore your passions. [Music] I'm calling huh I'm calling every single one of you out. I'm calling myself out. All this talk about dreams and drive and destiny. Countless conversations about what we love. inspirational quotes and motivational mantras. We're all talk and I've had enough. Hello Sharks. My name is Cash Shake. I'm the founder of Be Somebody and we're seeking $1 million for 10% of our company. We built the world's first experience marketplace with a vision to pioneer experiential learning. On our platform, you can learn anything that you're passionate about by booking experiences with talented people around you. You book them online, then you meet up in person for a hands-on learning experience. And the host of our experiences, who we call passionaries, get to make money doing what they love. , Robert, if you want to add ninja skills to your already sexy repertoire of scuba diving and car racing, you could book an experience with Ninja Warrior Travis Brewer. [Music] Cool. There goes. , wow. Yeah. Damn. [Music] Hey D McK ladies, if you guys wanted to ignite your dormant passion for dance, which I know y'all have, you could book a group experience and you can learn anything from ballet to ballroom to Bollywood. Yeah. Wow. [Music] All . [Music] Yeah. And Mark, you can book a soccer experience. You can learn from the best twotime World Cup champion, twotime Olympic gold medalist, Christine Lily. Wow. [Music] What's up, Christine? Hello. How you doing? How are you? Good. Hello, Sharks. I'm here today as a be somebody passionary and someone who truly loves this company and everything it stands for and they will host all our soccer experiences exclusively on their platform. Sharks, we believe we have the mission, the movement and the model and we would love for all of you to join us on this world changing journey. Thank you much to our amazing passionaries and be somebody. Thanks. Thank you guys. Great. Tell us a little bit about your background. , back in 2009, I was seven years into my role at Proctor and Gamble, the largest consumer products company in the world. I was leading social marketing for a lot of our bigger brands Tide and Old Spice. And I turned 30. I was going through a breakup and I was trying to figure out what my purpose was in life. And that's when I first started to realize as soon as you start to focus your mind and your heart and your spirit and your soul on your passions, the universe starts to open up doors and unlock windows you never thought possible. And the p and I started to learn the power of this word because it's intuitive and instantly personal to people. When people around the world hear be somebody, it becomes about you and about what you love, becomes about your personal passion, whether it's photography or car racing or fashion, that's what's powerful about it. And as soon as I started to see that there was something there, I got a chance to leave PNG and go lead social marketing at GoPro for working for somebody next. You're doing a lot of talking and you're not getting anywhere now, ? What's the end product? What am I Let me show you guys. , we built an iOS app. This is my profile. You see all your profiles here. , this is my profile page. If you hit that little plus, it opens up all my passions. You can add as many as you want. You can create them and then our algorithm takes everything you're passionate about. Then shows you experiences around you in your local area. It's an experience marketplace. Think about Airbnb. When you're booking houses here, you can book an experience and then you can book individual training. What's great question? We take 20% of every experience that's booked on our platform. On average, $40 an experience. You have to aggregate a whole bunch of passionaries. By the way, I love your name, Cash. Thank you. But unfortunately, I've learned that happiness can't buy money. , I've got to understand how fast you can scale this thing I can make cash. . , what we have, we have a global movement that reaches 5 million people. That means 5 million people a month are either dropping this be somebody hashtag. If you guys search it now, get out, get on your phone, search that, but is that of your company or in general be somebody? I trade I was the first person in history. If you put in hashtag and B, it'll pop up and someone could still click on it. it doesn't mean necessarily. We own every asset with be somebody. That's fine. it's GoPro we we branded the the fisheye. Trying to see what connects to revenue. I'm a little confused what the platform is. Is the idea we get together and do an activity we white water rafting or is it a training platform where I go to an expert whitewater rafting person? Great question. I wanted to get back to the scale question. I think that's important. The number one way we found a scale is through strategic partnerships. You guys heard from Christine Lily. How do you protect yourself against Barbara and I, we go white water rafting, a big jagged rock comes up, somebody pushes her off the boat, she cracks her head to the white meat. Before her husband gets a brand new sexy wife, he sues somebody. How do you protect yourself against lawsuits that? now, we haven't had that problem. We know we're have to figure out if you had that problem. I think that's the reason we're raising capital, , because we need somebody lose it in a law to insure yourself. Do you have a disclaimer? , what happened? , how long have you been offering experience? 12 months in Austin, Texas in 2015. 12 months as a beta, you said. Yeah. are you open to everybody yet? Yeah. At the end of 2015, we decided we're going to our focus is scale. the first six months of 2016, we've been closing partnerships. $80,000. How many How many experiences did you book last month? Probably about $2,000. . again, we have building a global your answer to the potential litigation was you're raising capital. Is that to get a big insurance policy? , how Every passionary that hosts a fitness or outdoor experience has to have liability insurance on their own. It's part of our terms with the strategic partnerships when we scale. The reason why they're partnering with us, there's three reasons. One, because they believe in the mission. You heard Christine Lily. Two, because they have a shared traffic. Why would she give you exclusivity when you have nobody on this? Because you probably had to qualify the exclusivity to an app or something specific as opposed to all bookings, ? We know all bookings. 100% bookings. All the 100% of their revenue is dependent on you, ? Listen, you guarantee her any minimums? No, we didn't. We didn't. , but but you got to understand people. She's going to starve. She's begging for Mark. No, because even he's running out of cash up here. One second. to finish here, we become a payment platform and a tool for them. But I think the guys, what's the most important part about this is people believe in what we stand for. I'm going to show you guys one thing real quick. my god. , I think I think it's important. I I used to carry this around back in 2011. A little 8 by11 car that I met myself when I was going around the world to try to inspire people. You're killing us. Did you bring a collection plate? All six sharks are still in. But Mark has an issue with Cash selling the passion more than the merits of his business. Be Somebody, a booking platform for experiences. Cash. Rule number one, the longer the backstory, the worse the deal. , , let me tell you about our business. More preaching always equals less money for the investor. For those two reasons, I'm out. . I find you enormously abrasive. You drive me nuts. I feel as though you don't have the capacity to listen. Could you imagine what a partner you would make for me? I'm out. . Cash. Here's the beauty of a social platform. Here's the beauty of a movement. A movement by nature is viral, ? You're not getting that growth. No, it's working. what? It's working. We don't we don't have passionaries yet because we haven't we haven't scaled our marketplace. , my BS and I'm not calling you out on this. I'm saying my my sense for that always goes up. I I don't understand the business, ? , I'm out. I'm going to jump in. , there's many apps out there. It seems to me this is not going to be one that's going to make it. I'm out. Cash. How much How much of your own money do you have in this? $200,000. Wow. $200,000. You're pioneering experiential learning. No, you're not. Education is a $4.1 trillion industry. Online learning is going three times as fast. Preach. Preach. Important. It's important. I still never got over how you're going to protect yourself against liabilities. I think you're going to have a lot of people teaching dangerous things and one lawsuit can kill the entire company. I'm out. Let's leave all the passion and all this the kumbaya kumbaya. Leave it aside for a second. In the end, Shark Tank's about making money. We built a brand. Kevin, I'm going to put you. what's going to screw you up, Cash? The fact that you're believing your own nonsense. You got to do the work. Beat somebody doesn't get done, bro. You got to do What do you think I've been doing for for three years talking? No, we haven't. We built a community from this. He's an instructor. We built a passionate community. Go online. search be somebody. You're going to get inspired by all the stories that you hear. The people that are here, they're inspired by the movement to have an opportunity. Cash. Silence. We're going to own the experience. I'm calling you out. In eight years of history, you're one of the first people to ever have six shots at this. . You struck out on everyone. Zero. I'm out. See you, buddy.

I'm seeking $50,000 for a 5% equity stake in my company. Now, whether or not we it, we all know someone who's been cheated on, been accused of cheating, or who's cheated. Let me show you a situation that happens to millions of people every day. Who is that? No way. What is this? Jenny. Jenny from your work? Yeah, it's me. What is this? Are you cheating on me? No. You liar. Have you been there, Kevin? Whoa. Tell me, tell tell me more. , Kate helps prevent fights this simply by keeping your indiscretions discreet. simply, Kate is a smartphone application. And with it, you select a blacklist of contacts. And if those contacts call or text you, Kate will intercept those calls and texts and store them within its interface. , even if your significant other is looking directly at your phone when blacklist contacts or text you, she'll have no idea it happened. Let's say if Tiger had Kate, he might still be married to Elen. It's been estimated that 80% of marriages have at least one cheating partner. Shut it off. For real. We to say love is blind. We keep it that way. Neil, this is a cheaters app. But in reality, it's a privacy app. , let's call a spade a spade. It's a cheaters app. I'm with that. It's a cheaters app. Good for you, Neil. Go with it, baby. Own it. Neil, for Yes. Why did you develop this? You don't seem the cheater type of guy. You are correct. But I didn't develop the app. What I've done pretty much since I was 14. I was a hustler. I sold Pokemon cards on eBay. I went to college, did the four-year degree thing, but I couldn't get a job that I wanted. Went back to Pokemon cards. I found the app. But you're not a developer, ? You didn't develop this. No. Tell us the story there. How did you find it? What What happened? I found a guy selling this app. Turns out to be a cop. He doesn't have time for this app. , a cop developed a cheaters app. Correct. How much did you pay the cop? 17,500. You paid him 175. Wow. , you have 100% ownership of this between me and my sister? Yes. We're a team. Is your app totally developed already? It's finished. It's developed. We We finished the iPhone version of it a week or two ago. , we have Android, iPhone, and Blackberry, which covers 85% of the cell phone market. And how much do you invested in it? All total, we're to date roughly around 45,000 currently. I don't know if cheating is good or bad cuz I've never done it, but I do understand there are people that have and they need a product this. , why don't you tell me a little bit about your sales? far, we have around 10,000 customers. And you have 10,000 paid customers. 5500 roughly paid customers and about 4,000 free customers. Now, how much did the 5,500 who paid for it, the actual cheaters, what did they pay? The app sells for $4.99 for Android and iPhone and $9.99 for Blackberry. All . , for in 3 months, you've sold how much? It's about 5,000 to 5,500 and 4,000 data. Today you think that app based on that is worth1 million $1 million. Yes. I think you're cheating. Neil, why are you offering us such little percentage? Do you want a deal? I do. And to be perfectly honest, I know the equity is negotiable, I figure I should come here with that and you leave it up to you guys. But but Neil, do you have any issues or concerns about the morality of the product you're promoting? Let's put it this way. What are you talking about? Let the guy answer a question for you. I don't care if you guys fighting. It's no. I'll put it in a better way. Let's say you didn't carrots, for example. Carrots. Carrots. But carrots sold at 100% markup. Are you going to say, \"I don't want to be a carrot farmer.\" Are you going to jump into that business ready to make money? Wait, wait, wait. In other words, you're going to go where the money is is what you're saying. This is not morality tank. The only immoral aspect of your deal is a crazy valuation. It's not worth a million dollars. That's for you guys to decide. That's what I believe. I think we're telling you now, look, I'm not going to sit around and listen anymore. I understand the business. I'll give you the $50,000 for 50%. I'd to hear the other offers. Are there any other apps that you could use this programming code base for that you've considered? What do you mean? Let me give you one now. In the mutual fund industry, competitors don't their sales data to be shown on a phone. I'm going to use this in my business on all the sales reports. That's exactly. , I think there are apps that'll make sense there and this is one of them. And there it's there if nothing else to prevent fights. if to prevent more fights. a lot of a lot of girlfriends that I've known have had boyfriends who are overly jealous and they have guy friends and the boyfriend doesn't want to see the guy friend text message her. you get to keep your friends and keep your boyfriend happy and everyone keep them alive. See, you're saving people's lives. That's what I think I'm doing. Yeah. I'm a firefighter. I your passion. I the fact that you're a hustler. I don't the app. I'm out. There's a website out there that promotes cheating. I know it. The guy who runs it and owns it is a close personal friend of mine. We summer together. I'm going to him after we form our partnership. Now, it's hard for me to believe that you don't cheat. I don't cheat. I'm kidding. I don't cheat. I believe in what you believe in. . I know the only thing that matters in life is what? Money. Yes. Of course. You and me, we are in sync. I'm going to give you $50,000 now for 50%. Let's go. I have to hear the rest of the offers. , do we have any other offers? Neil, I'll make it I make it simple. I have a different philosophy. I don't think it's all about money. I I don't want to be I don't want to be involved in any business where I can't bring my kids to work. [Music] I'm out. Damon, what are you doing? I have to be honest. This is not my field. , what I would to do if he would allow me and I would be partners with Kevin to make this a stronger deal if he allows me in. All . I'm interested and I'm going to agree. , Kevin and Damon are in at 50,000 for 50%. You have a hard offer on the table. What are you going to do? , I happen to love this concept. I happen to think it has enormous application. All . My husband was a FBI agent and used to have snitches in white collar crime that would call him and the biggest problem was they didn't want their name on his cell phone. , for sure. If it wasn't narrowed as a cheaters app and it was a privacy app, I think it has a tremendous amount of applications. , I'd to make you an offer. Two sharks are out. Neil has one offer on the table from Kevin and Damon, but Barbara wants in on the action. , I'd to make you an offer for $50,000 for 30% of your business, provided you're open to repositioning it as a privacy app versus a cheaters app. , this is one of these situations where you have to decide. You can work with a real estate agent who has no history in software at all. And I'm being nice when I say that. Let me tell you what I was successful in. I was successful in taking a thousand dollar loan and building it into a $5 billion business. don't pull that card on me, Kevin. , I know I know that I don't know as much as Barbara. That's why I would have to come in with Kevin because together collectively, we can offer you that muscle that you need. Counter them. I'll offer you guys 15%. Whoa. Whoa. Hang on. Neil. Yes. You take it, Neil. You're countering to all three of them. Yes. 15% for 50,000. Correct. [Music] We're not in the same universe on this one. No. No. Thank you. It's all negotiations.

Look, I think the two of us bring much value to you that we have to get paid for it. Neil, this is your deal to lose. Neil, you have another offer on the table. It's a better deal. It's only for 30% for the $50,000. You're telling me for five points you're not coming with me? Are you out of your mind? Do you want to call him and look at that guy every day? Neil, who do you see more value in? I'm sorry, Barbara. I do see value. what I'll do? I'll drop it down to 25%. I'm not budging. There's a tremendous difference in value here. If you guys would do 75,000 for 35%, we have a deal now. You're looking at these guys. You're not entertaining this deal. I have to see if they'll take that because that would equalize the equity.

Operations helicopter pilot and the CEO of Haven the world's strongest Smart Lock and my name is Clay bakes I'm the COO of Haven we're from Nashville Tennessee and we're seeking $500,000 in exchange for 6% equity in our business sharks not long ago clay and I both experienced a series of break-ins in our neighborhoods in reality a break-in occurs every 18 seconds here in the United States we quickly realize it doesn't matter if you lock your doors or not the traditional deadbolt isn't getting the job done let me show you this is your standard deadbolt while it may feel secure when you lock it an experienced Intruder can get in in about five kicks Alex show them how easy this is come on Alex kick it hard come on Alex Alex come on Al kick it how much you sell the Deadlocks [Music] for look we don't need to buy this product [Laughter] hey there go get mad and a Breakin occurs every 18 seconds the door knobs about to fall yeah that's persistence are you this isn't going are you typically a Breakin can happen in less than 2 minutes in the United States one in 36 homes in America will have a Breakin smart locks based at the deadbolt are no better Alex sure we're going to show you how works as you can tell I'm not an experienced Intruder I'm good let's show them how Haven Works clay yeah Haven sits at the bottom of the floor next to the existing threshold when activated the wedge based barrier lifts up using simple physics this makes your entire door 10 times stronger to preventing home break-ins to use it you simply step on the gate to open the door to shut the door you lock it with the gate with the foot pedal and you can see there's no dead bolt here Alex here K show them how it goes do the fly kick [Music] Alex all sharks no finally got it that's baby we don't give up all that's we don't give service absolutely God Haven is still standing strong we've got some demos we'll show you Alex you've gone down in Shark Tank history you will be memorialized for connected version Mark you hell yeah here you go cool all I'm going to grab a quick drink of water clay once don't you start sharks we've got two products that we manufacture we have a Haven mechanical Mech that you have on this side we have an electronic controlled one and Mark's got it down here on this side it's got a key fob you have with your car it also has a smartphone app where you can share e keys I would be able to send you access to my house schedule that I would get notification when you come and go what is each cost our cost for the mechanical only one we sell it on our website for $182 it cost us $67 to make it our landed cost is $82 our profit margin on that is 55% what about the Bluetooth version how much the connect version we sell for $3.49 on our website now cost of good sold is $175 wow that's a lot think we can get that down it's our our first batch of production at that cost do you have a patent issued on this year yes sir we got issuance from the UK we're still pending in in the US there's nothing this that's on the floor floor and that stop somebody enter cover the entire door and for sliding doors could you do it at the top yes ma'am that's the other exciting thing we want to tell you about is due to recent current events schools started approaching us to put this in individual classrooms huge Market there's over 115,000 schools in this country this is to protect the classroom from anybody getting in our plan is to lock down a classroom within 1 second and give teachers access and give security resource officer SWAT team access to the it's a good idea that's a great idea I don't think you told us what our your sales were far we crossed the $250,000 Mark of of total sales where are you selling them we sell online on our on our own website how much money have you raised and how much debt do you have we've raised 1.5 million that's a lot wow and how much debt do you have if any we have two investors with a convertible note debt of a total of $500,000 there we go are you two the sole owners 25% each and then we have investors on top of that with additional Equity to sell the school situation what is it that you have underway with schools tell them about the purchase order we got in Arkansas in in Melbourne Arkansas we installed three locks about a month ago they had an open house the parents loved it the next day I got a call from the superintendent and said I've got 94 classrooms left to do in this school I want to put in an order that's a big order they order they order 94 yes ma'am what are you going to do with the money sure our biggest problem is inventory simply we're going to use part of your investment to go out and scale inventory with our suppliers guys look I think what you've done is brilliant Mark let's let's do a deal but the challenge is the your economics are awful your margins are awful to support what you what you need to we're starting our manufacturing we have made 2,000 locks and got those into the customers we paid way over for those first 2,000 we're not going to pay that for the next 10,000 or the next 20,000 I think you're going to have a pretty hard time figuring out how to get the scale and figuring out what works and what doesn't I don't want to be part of the journey I'm sorry I'm out thank you for I think you have a huge mountain to climb and something that I don't think we'd get our money back for me I'm out thank you Barbara thank you much appreciate your time pitch yeah guys I think it's going to be difficult particularly from a cash flow perspective it's going to take you raising your price to generate the margins until your costs come down and even then the margins aren't there guys how about sure I think this is smart the problem for me is I to understand a product when I invest in it and you might be too early I can't invest at this point I'm sorry I'm out thank you much for your time what come on Dam let's do a deal I'm interested in it but sometimes it's it's what's in the best interest for the entrepreneur too I can give you a shark deal then you may have to raise more capital and then you get diluted or give them some to start with what do you want let them decide the only reason we're here is to get one of you on this team to guide us to Mentor us to get us into distribution opportunities and help scale our cost down we want you on this team you're not going to what I'm going to say because me taking more of the company then you own is not in your best interest and I need you to be a little selfish for yourself I'm not going to give you an offer I'm out thank you Damon thank you sharks good luck guys congratulations I am definitely a customer though this isn't our first objection and it's not going to be our last but there's a problem out there worth solving and we're going to keep going after it we're going to continue on the the team follows the motto that I lived in the Army we're never going to quit

in exchange for 10% of our company forell shars do you a pizza sharks what's even worse than what my grandfather Vinnie would think about my fake Italian accent it's the quality of homebaked Pizza in a conventional oven let's be honest it's complete garbage now imagine baking authentic Neapolitan style wood fired pizza at over 900\u00b0 in your own backyard introducing Brello wood fire and gas outdoor pizza of our oven has multiple fuel options you can use the propane burner attachment or you can use wood kindling what that's not all sharks you can also use lump charcoal what but wait there's more he can use wood pellets wow what and with our patent Pena design you can use wood with gas at the same time what Sharks next time someone asks you to take a bite out of a frozen pizza or a takeen baked pizza cooked in a home conventional oven forget about it [Applause] sharks let's do a deal capish my God are you are you going to do the pitch that good good great bad theater good bad theater wow yes and my chopped liver where's my pie we' to invite you up Kevin you C pizza with us my God are you cleaning up you going to make a pie is that the idea yes yes wow that's good good see how I'm doing this out of the skill a little bit more now I want to put a little cheese on pepperon is great thank you much I'm going to do combination put some pepperoni down on here all you're going to want to shake it back and forth to get it moving don't worry I'm skilled at this all beautiful how long am I waiting to take my pie out you want to rotate it every 20 to 30 seconds I already know that all how many minutes per Pizza up to two Max ma 2 minutes great for a party I think I'm almost done yeah you could rotate it thank you you're burning it he should have rotated a little carbon with my pizza nothing wrong with that yeah now that's what I'm talking about beautiful is that done matter of preference good job Kevin thank you I'm taking this with me Robert's eaten his entire one nice it was good this is good thank you much good is there anything on the market this now we do have one competitor but they do not have the ability to use wood with gas at the same time and they don't have as many fuel options as us what's the advantage of using wood and propane as opposed to wood or propane with the propane you can preheat the oven you heat the oven up 5 minutes before you're going to cook throw some wood in get the flame rolling it's faster yeah faster and easy is this allowed to be used indoor I would not generally recommend using indoor it be similar to using a gas grill inside how much does it cost it's 250 what's that's it what does it cost you to make 84 landed wow what's your net margin our our net is 33 guys where are you selling it how much have you sold we're selling on Amazon this year we've done 640,000 wow we've done 400,000 in the last 3 months good for you how much money have you guys invested have you taken any outside investors any debt we have probably $90,000 into it we borrowed $70,000 at the beginning of the year and paid all of that back that's the inventory good for funded yeah for for inventory is it the two of you alone in the business yes 50/50 Partners 8020 what's the story you guys chefs yeah I'm a licensed structural engineer I've been that makes sense I've been working in Manhattan for 10 years doing bridge design and Bridge inspection I'd climb to the top of all the biggest Bridges around Manhattan climb to the top of them climb to the top verizo Queensboro Bridge Williamsburg Manhattan Bridge dang I'm in finance out of college College I went down I worked in the biggest open outcry trading pits since then moved back to Minnesota wife kids and work in financial services did you design this or did you have someone else do it with you I did everything what's been the largest obstacle you've had to overcome is keeping up with the the demand a nice FR we would have to wait to get money from our current order to put money down for the next order why would you want to build your own pizza oven when there's at least five that I know exist what is the personal motivation to say forget the five that are already in the market I'm going to go and try and get share with a new yeah no I go for it I think big when I was 10 years old I started building a treehouse and I made probably the biggest treehouse in the entire United States you're an engineer a Ewok village massive I worked on it from age 10 until I was 23 years old which discipline dedication that's being all in and I look back at it now and I realize I have a certain quality I'm get super passionate about whatever I do and I'm I'm obsessed with it guys look what you've accomplished is great your margins are good you're selling through the challenge is you're still a consumer product it's not a business I want to get attached to but I'm not that guy who let's heat up the grill and let's go build make some pizza in the backyard it's not a fit for me for those Reasons I'm out no problem thank you Mark congrats guys when you came out I was excited obviously I love the pizza but I don't know I'm sitting here I'm not excited about it for some reason I don't know whether it's there's much competition I'm not seeing the connection between the Andy and Eric pizza show the oven and how are you going to go to mass market and for that reason I'm out I think it's a beautifully designed oven but I'll tell you what I can't get here when you did your dog and pony show we were jumping in our seat and then you got hit with a pizza and then everything changed are you still recovering for that what what's happened your energy went no what's happened I'd love you to address that because that's my main point of concern two sharks are out Barbara may be interested in Eric and Andy's Woodfired Pizza Oven berell but she is concerned about their lack of energy no what's happening I'd love you to address that because that's my main point of concern yeah no I'm super energetic but yeah absolutely even the way you said that wasn't energetic I'm super energetic me talk that's the boy I'll talk this I can talk this no but now it feels an act I know before it felt you now it feels an act it's bad theater but what about that I'm matching the the tone and energy of the room Barbara what he's saying is you're putting him to sleep no I love it's an odd thing because usually I buy into products that I'm not that crazy about the product and I love the entrepreneur yeah and I do with it I've never been mistaken when I follow my heart on the entrepreneurs but I I I don't think I've ever been in a position where I love the produ I live eat sleep and breathe this this piece of it I work on this 7 days a week 2 47 I happen I think it would do in retail it doesn't take up a lot of space the price point is good it looks luxurious I'm absolutely open to that option we've been the best an offer I'll give you $120,000 but I need 25% could you do I also have an offer I'd get behind this as Chef wonderful and sell a lot of it because I'm an amazing chef but I want more it's it's you Eric and a bunch of money required for invent and probably more optimization on digital that you've never done but I want 30% if I get behind this the numbers will be up tfold would you do it for 25% yes we' love to take a [Music] deal I don't believe it I won't step in that but i' got to be don't congratulations guys thank you you that woo we got the same offer from Barbara and Kevin but we went with Kevin because he believed in us from the start and he made an offer away Barbara wasn't sure Barbara you said to him he had no energy hard to get a deal when you call somebody boring maybe you're you're about that but that proves that they didn't recover from that I I hope you lose all your money I hope you lose your money why you being mean Barb I'm being mean cuz I'm annoyed that's why\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:**

exchange for 3.14 of my company three point one it's pi day sharks everybody has bad habits and for some of us they're minor nail biting hitting the snooze button but for others they can be much more serious or even deadly meet pavlok the first wearable that doesn't track what you do but changes what you do padlock helps you become aware by alerting you when you do behaviors you'd to reduce and simply press the button and pavlock releases a mild electric sensation that helps you reduce cravings you can laugh but it's something serious i am laughing it releases a mild electric sensation that helps you reduce cravings and breaks bad habits in the brain pavlok harnesses scientific methods that have been researched for decades but it's not research since launch our users have had incredible success in changing their behaviors now sharks which of you wants to join us in our mission to help people across the globe take control of their own behavior how did you come up with this idea i've always had severe atd i could never get myself to get stuff done i couldn't get myself to commit to anything i did what any normal person would do i hired someone to sit down next to me and slap me in the face every time i went on facebook and i wrote a blog post about it seriously yeah it's cool video and the blog post went insanely viral did they slide yeah this video of me getting slapped but did you get the work done i did yeah it was cool stuff yeah what made you come up with this idea yeah i was visiting a friend of mine i'm dude why are we why am i paying i could make a make a zapper that zaps every time i go on facebook [Music] after one moment i want to explain the science behind it and then i'll bring it out for you padlock uses a type of science called aversive conditioning it was common in the 1960s it's a slight electric stimulus that's done while doing a undesired bad habit and it rapidly trains your reptile brain to associate that uncomfortable stimulus with the bad habit this is based on the problem principle can you explain that principle to us sure when you add two stimuli together at the same time your brain doesn't know what is causing the stimuli to occur it knows that they're both happening at the same time and it starts to retreat i'll go ahead and bring it out for you now to try on there you go mr herchevec this one yeah please put it on for me it's got your name engraved on it and everything wow i the design of that thank you and you notice mr cube thank you sir i simply press the lightning bolt on the top of it press down hard there you go it's a little pulse yeah i set it low for you because i didn't want everybody to get scared can you search it higher yeah i'll do now all get out turn it back turn it down wow how do you turn it i feel it but let me come back to our results in a study that we based our first experiment with it was a aversive conditioning study that was done in 1988 with 832 subjects wait wait let's let's qualify for five you said we based our first study on suggesting that sure that you did the study i'll tell you about a study we did after but you can look through our evidence pamphlet where we have 21 clinical trials i bite my nails i'm trying to not bite my nails all the time where it falls down for me is if i have the discipline to buzz myself do i not have the discipline to stop people people do you have a discipline to stop i don't do you wish you could stop i do can i here's your premises robert it's all nonsense across the board i can't get around that i'm i want to bite my nails and for me to stop i have to hit this thing sure why can't laurie buzz it for me she can't i'm she absolutely can there's a remote control there's a there's a remote control app there's automation what percentage of time does it not work it doesn't work if you don't want it to work it does wow yeah of course if you use it on sugar after about three or four days on a cookie or tortilla chips you'll start to notice the flavor changes now what's interesting about it in the first doctor knows it's the flavor changes yeah you're such a con artist i'm absolutely not as for results mark more than 50 percent of our users break their habit in five days or less first of all first of all let me give you the want to get a deal skepticism to me why you're worth 14 million dollars 15. 50. what is it how much number one number one our sales are great what are you doing what are your sales and we began shipping this week we've sold 800 000 of revenue wait wait pre-orders three-fourths of the users were pre-orders and one-fourth of the users were prototypes what did each of those people pay for one device 200 how much 200 who buys these our biggest users are sitting too long waking up on time nail biting and eating we've started to build out multiple cool integrations for this product the first thing is the alarm clock it's the first alarm clock that works you get when you get a slight zap in the morning it knocks you away with a life of adrenaline great way to start the day yeah you'd be surprised that people love it how could you guys be gullible read the evidence it's none of it's yours no one's disputing aversion therapy yeah we're conversion therapy we're bringing aversion therapy together you can't be that stupid robert do you even think there's any legitimacy calm down my gosh you guys are making me eddy all let me talk about we make you a dc's make it happen all denise you're a strange dude some of the cool stuff we're doing that mr cuban would is this we've i don't think mark's gonna anything yeah virgin therapy is legit but what's not legit is trying to take credit for other studies and apply it to your products [Music] with all the citations sir you got a booklet none of those studies are related these are studies these are aversion therapies version therapy studies outside your realm not necessarily that's the strongest point here is that this isn't based on anything that you've done are you negotiating we have had your studies quit their addiction and fight in five days seven days or less but you don't have any proof that it changes more than half of our users quit more than 81 percent of our users quit nail-biting in four days where is your proof of this what study do you have you should be doing clinical trials why don't you have clinical trials all i'm gonna make it simple i talk about things i say things are either heroes or zeros for me this is a nowhere nero i'm out i find your presentation is exhausting and complicated and i couldn't imagine having the energy to deal with this doesn't sound positive barbara i'm out lori barbara history i'd to talk a little bit about our numbers this year let me finish sure when you first came out i liked it it's happened habit creates discipline discipline creates more habit and that's how you get success what i don't about is you have a 16 million dollar valuation on pre-orders it's too much i'm out i understand absolutely robert thank you much look if you had verifiable proof that all your aversion therapy can be executed with your device you wouldn't need to import other people's studies because with all this advanced money you got you could have gone to any university and said what we don't want to rush it we want to get our own verifiable studies in place that no one can question us the one thing that kills tech products is hyperbole because at some point you have to execute you violated listen to me now your turn to listen if you would have said what this is a reminder and everybody is different we have different ways to remind you but you went over the top with nonsense it is everything but a legitimate product and for those reasons i'm out let me tell you what let me let me come back to you guys i want to answer the question there is a medical component to this but shock yourself for a minute you're a combination of spontaneous combustion and add mixed together i'm not kidding it's difficult to listen to you yeah luckily for you i got my undergrad in psychology to make money i worked on a rhesus study that used the same technology how many other degrees and i'm telling you the truth here i'm interested [Music] [Music] four sharks are out but kevin seems interested in manisha's habit-breaking watch pavlok i believe this technology works because i've seen it work your valuation is crazy i'm sorry it's not worth 50.9 million now i'm going to solve the problem in the deal structure i'm creative i'll give you the 500 000 as debt on the home you're going to give me the 3.14 percent as equity today and you're going to walk out of here with a shark tank here i'm going to put it on for 24 months at seven and a half percent and balloon payment be back in two years if one third of projections are you can easily do that it's an offer it's an offer this is the problem damn there's a there's no problem the problem mr wonderful is that it's we're not focused on the money we're focused more on focused on the money you've come to the wrong place my friend i'm here to make money let it finish kev our biggest thing our biggest goal is to break bad habits around the world and mr wonderful i i i can't work with you why not i'm worried that if we work together him i do him as a person but i feel as an investor in the company would be bad manish you didn't want an offer here today you want an offer you got one and why don't you want the structure of that offer the structure is good what's the person it's the person i feel i would take an offer from anybody besides mr wonderful manish you already get them out of here if you are you all out yeah we're all left done monies all thank you much [Music] i have a tinge of regret for rejecting the deal with mr wonderful but the truth is our company is building something much bigger than money we're trying to change human behavior and kevin wouldn't be the partner for us to work with youI would take an offer from anybody besides Mr Wonderful ew worst presentation ever I'm out that was me I'm about to throw water at these two guys let me let me tell you what I think [Music] I have a few watches for each of you guys to have no thanks go ahead you keep it it's Dallas Mavericks blue for you you keep it thank you Mark are you allergic to positive negative ion stuff no I'm allergic to scams seriously this is not new it's been disproven it's a joke it's a scam it's not real I'm out how do you get the negative ions in this rubber band with a wand [Laughter] I'm trying to figure out if I can make any money in this deal Kevin I'm going to warn you if you even try to make money from this I will come over and beat the living crap out of you it's horrible how about this if you admit it's a scam maybe I'll invest is it a scam I don't I don't believe it is I don't see an option here except to say I'm out why are you ignoring what I'm saying I'm sorry I'm talking to you and you're looking over it Mark Sarah I'm telling you that I'm in there Mark I'm into all of this I want to help you want to finish the customer I've been taking zinc for years I'm a Believer in this I'm the one talking about antibiotic resistance and how important it is but the fact that when I'm talking to you you don't even look at me I'm out I didn't mean to offend you Lori I'm sorry I feel you don't respect me as a female sitting here you don't then prove me why I looked at you when you came out here you were looking at everybody else not me I sensed some chauvinism here and I I I'm out again if you think we can add much value why are you valuing our contributions as the exact same as any other investor in this note we're also going to start doing a lot of partnership with celebrities and influencers because you who wait wait wait wait wait wait there I'm out I'm out out out I would be reluctant to get above the 600 000. shocking [Music] what a fancy voice I'm about to throw water at these two guys could we possibly come in at 300 000 and maybe for ten percent no no no no no no no Sir Richard Branson asking a question it has to be 600. let me let me tell you what I I'm out of here you make a good point it's old Tech but there's a ton of old Tech in real estate because it's sleepy Valley I've already seen the new tech out there there I used it last week no the key isn't the software the software is the easiest part no no Mark you're not making any sense at all I'm making total sense no no you're not we're no no where how stupid are you aware of that place I know this is going over your head no it's not do you think people drive down the street and look for houses shut up and listen don't be mad at me that I understand that's better than you do look look how any agent gets into a house with the other technology they walk up boom they're in the house what you're saying what the agents do you can enable for the consumers absolutely I guess we're catching up except if you're not using the agent you don't want to call the agent and you want to make it available that the keys are there and somebody who's comfortable with keys can you connect a lot of guys I wish you luck getting your money back obviously Chris we all agree we disagree no you got it wrong Chris I sometimes wonder how you made all that money mark you're such a con artist I'm absolutely not as for results Mark more than 50 of our users break their habit in five days in seven days or less let me leave the skepticism how could you guys be gullible read the evidence disputing aversion therapy yeah reversion therapy we're bringing a version therapy to Consumers using other people's studies we know you're the smartest guy in the room you can't be that stupid Robert to even think there's any legitimacy you had verifiable proof that all your aversion therapy can be executed with your device you wouldn't need to import other people's studies the one thing that kills Tech products is hyperbole because at some point you have to execute it now you're trying to listen if you would have said what this is a reminder and everybody is different we have different ways to remind you but you went over the top with nonsense it is everything but a legitimate product and for those Reasons I'm out here's what I'll do I'll give you 250k for 20 but if you if you want to hear all the options I don't want to waste my time I'll take a nap you guys let me know if you want me in for 250. let me know if not I'll let you play with them let them bully you huh I'm interested as I think it's a great product and I don't think there's anything it I do have the ability to reach that same Sports demographic through my role at the Miami Dolphins or huge soccer tournament can reach anybody can reach anybody you're 16 000 Instagram yeah now we're showing I love it we're bragging about Instagram wait I gotta pause on that all moving on I want to understand something do you have goals and do you Aspire and can you 100 what are you moaning about because he's unloading it's not relevant it's not relevant it is no these guys have no money Innovation and their lack of these are the same offer as Kevin Lori you've got a deal I'm disappointed I'm gonna throw the ball at you now power [Music] how am I going to convince you the physician to put your profile up there and detail the services that you offer that's easy there's 800 000 USPS I didn't ask what the market was there's a hundred places to put profiles what are you going to do to convince doctors you have business connections we have medical connections we're going to launch in Arizona Texas and Chicago Connections we're going to tell them that this is the best way to Brand yourself or are you going to tell them I'm pulling teeth I should be a dentist you're not going to let them tell me how I make money because there's no chance of you making money on this targeted advertising is how you're getting a secure environment you can do targeted advertising not gonna happen I get that you're trying to recreate Twitter and Facebook onto rollodoc correct but I want to do this eye to eye face to face because you're doctors foreign presentation ever I'm out that was me ever you guys should be smart enough to know it was horrible I would have to agree with Mark I think it was the worst sales presentation I've heard if you can get Kevin to invest all the money I will help him and you to sell it you put up the money I'll do this you want to put up 250 000. I can call you later my sleeves and I'll do the sales that's something we can deal with later look Evan I'll put up the 500 000 but one way or another I'm ending up as a 50 50 partner yes or no Evan what do you want to do but why wouldn't you not want to include I might but she's not putting up any money now I'm not worried about it this is your moment yes or no do you have anything that we could you could add that's it I'm out get I'm an investor I had the 500 it was in your hand and you're talking to her you're out of here see you buddy goodbye Scott you're saying that the proprietary patent which you say you have now yes I do is what you're selling me why aren't you bundling it all together why are you being greedy and Savage because I'm you what I'd you to understand is that what my other company has been doing has been building the brand of Technology enabled it's ridiculous that is ridiculous that's common sense wires in wires out that's what's killing this country that we get dumbass patents that people then turn around and Sue it's ridiculous the intellectual property is built about running a wire through clothing a wire velcro it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because Wireless is what's next wires will not go away with battery power and and for this time being for music I don't agree I'll put low power Bluetooth into the shoulder let it distribute to all the other devices and to the headphones and kick your ass I'm out you were out from the moment you sat down I you're no loss your wife represent me and suing you for wasting my time because that's what you're doing now you didn't come to make a deal I didn't waste your time don't waste hours thank God what seriously what the hell you point at me and you tell me I'm out bye bye show a little more respect wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel for that reason I'm out\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** boston, massachusetts, Dallas, Arizona, Texas (GPE), first (ORDINAL), more than 50 percent, more than 81 percent, the 3.14 percent, ten percent (PERCENT), 14 million dollars, 16 million dollar (MONEY), cuban (NORP), seven and a half percent, hours (TIME), a ton, 500 000 (QUANTITY), Valley, the Miami Dolphins (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** you guys, an offer, our users, bad habits, the top, my nails, five days, other people's studies\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 visit: friend\n  \u2022 bring: it\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 press: lightning bolt\n  \u2022 set: it\n  \u2022 turn: it\n  \u2022 bring: aversion therapy\n  \u2022 get: booklet\n  \u2022 talk: bit\n  \u2022 create: habit\n\n**Sentiment:** Neutral (polarity: 0.04)\n\n**Topics:** study, money, guy, habit, time",

sharks wouldn't have been nice to know who was behind the door before you let me in with my product you can my name is jamie siminoff i'm from los angeles california my product is the doorbot i'm seeking 700 000 for a 10 stake in the company consumers are currently spending billions of dollars outfitting their homes with products that work with smartphones however one of the most ubiquitous technologies the doorbell has not changed since it was invented in 1880 until now introducing the doorbot the first ever video doorbell built for the smartphone with doorbot you can see and speak with visitors from anywhere but i didn't invent doorbot to make our lives more convenient it also adds needed security let me show you mark let's say this is your house in dallas you'll see on the screen here that i'm projecting the doorbell app for my smartphone to make it easier to see the demo now a regular call when someone rings the doorbot you can see them and decline if it's a someone that you don't want to talk to or accept and say hello to your visitor think of it as caller id for your front door [Music] hey good looking doorbot guy hey mark it's your good friend mr wonderful i wanted to have you join me on this deal with doorbot i think we can get them to go all royalties and no equity mark we know that no real entrepreneur's gonna accept that deal and now you can tell mr wonderful to scram and the best thing is you can do it without having to be face to face with him now sharks join me and the next time you hear it'll be now who wants me first to ring my bell jamie what if you hit accept you hit accept then the light goes blue and then you can talk to them your voice comes out of it your voice comes out of it it's got a microphone and speaker it's two-way audio one-way video if someone came up and said eyeball there can they take it off because all burglars ring the doorbell first what though mark that's true burglars are not usually violent criminals they want to see if someone's home they want the opportunity to go into a house that's not that does not have people in it it's true people do ring the doorbell it's hard to remove and we also have offered that any customer that has one stolen we will replace it for free of charge and how much does each one of these units sell for 199 what are your costs to make it 81.83 is our cost landed in our warehouse in the united states and you sell it to retailers far we've only sold direct on our own online store we are launching with our first retailer in november which is staples we launched nine months ago we've done an aggregate a million dollars in sales far good for you and you've done a million dollars far wow and the last month we've done 250 000 in sales our sales have grown month over month all online jamie all online all direct do you have any competitors currently we do not have any direct competitors when i say direct we're the first video doorbell built for the smartphone now there are other video doorbells out there that go to a panel it's not two-way you don't have communication from that you can see who's there competition costs the lowest price camera would be 50 to 100 up to thousands of dollars for many systems but we're not trying to compete with the hundred thousand dollar systems that integrate cameras and everything in your home that's that that means a totally different market what we're trying to do is disrupt that market to give that to everybody the norm to give it to my wife who's at home who's in the bedroom with my five-year-old i'm away and at eight o'clock at night and it's dark out someone knocks on the door i the product but are there bigger solutions that can come in and push this out the door this category will exist the doorbell will stay there it doesn't get trumped by technology i'm going to drive that there's a thousand different ways to alert what business is not going to get replaced by future technology but they're here it's about being able to be nimble and be part of that change i'm going gonna jump in here i think that you have potential to do a lot more with this but i'm not connecting to that this does enough at this time to distinguish itself is different from what else is out there on the market for the higher price point and for that reason i'm up we're not comparing ourselves to a a cheap video doorbell that has a little tiny no one's arguing the quality of the product i it i think you're going to do great with it but i've got to be able to say what when i jump in i've got to add enough value that this company still being worth 7 million could be worth 80 million 90 million i don't see that progression and for that reason i'm out when i when i look at businesses i look at the three tiers that could hit luxury mid tier and lower tier obviously we understand the luxury market where we have the 20 and 30 thousand dollar systems and all that type of stuff that's not for that the mid tier is the adt's of the world that most likely will add this to their services in some sense i i'm wrestling with where this goes in the market i don't think it's for me i'm out personally i'm a security guy the idea of having another access point on my house that freaks me out a little bit because all those adt and all those other ones are hardwired i can't hack into those i think you've priced a lot of value into it but i think my real struggle with is it's not an internet play it's a consumer device but you're pricing out 199 that that price point is going to start dropping quickly as your volumes go up for that reason that matters [Music] sorry about that don't send them to my house it's it's you and you now jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i gonna regret that mr wonderful [Music] four sharks are out kevin is jamie's last chance at a deal jamie let's take stock what's happened here you made a few jokes about mr wonderful the beginning and about the royalty structure am i going to regret that mr wonderful the only person left is mr wonderful i'll make you an offer i'll give you seven hundred thousand dollars i want a ten percent royalty that drops down to seven after i recoup the seven hundred thousand and i get five percent of the company's equity today we we have a vision i think to build a a big company out of this and i can't give someone 10 of all of our sales because it'll bleed us of cash while we need it the most i'm providing you factoring capital you need my 700 000 for inventory but but respectfully i can raise that money through venture debt or line of credit or something else then what's not the why don't you counter me with a venture dead off i would do seven hundred thousand dollars for a ten percent interest rate with a three percent equity kicker no not interested that doesn't it that doesn't it's not commensurate with the risk i'm taking honestly i do appreciate the offer but at the same time that money that you'd be taking on the royalty i need to reinvest back in this business what's the difference between the interest and the royalty the interest is cheaper the interest i can get rid of i can pay you back you don't the the royalty in perpetuity absolutely but i took the risk up front i believed in you the only shark i might add that did 700 000 is a lot of money it is a lot of money absolutely it's a lot of money jamie it's that moment when i say you're dead to me because you don't want to take my offer i made you a valid offer i think under the circumstances respectfully mr wonderful we're going to decline go kick some ass jimmy thank you much yeah good luck sharks kevin he was hi he was wavering there was a moment where he considered it i would have done that to you whatever happened to peeking through the window and saying go away mr wonderful gave us an offer for royalties on the company and i don't believe you can

'n Mes is iets waaraan die meeste Amerikaners raak Elke dag tog mes skerp mooi antieke kunsvlyt het amper verlore gegaan en is nie gedigitaliseer nie. Omtrent almal het dowwe messe Tuis. Mense hou daarvan om 'n skerp te gebruik Mes. Maar baie min mense weet hoe waar ons selfs die tyd het om te kry di\u00e9 mes geslyp. En dis die rede waarom ons Mes 8 begin het. dit is hoe eenvoudig dit werk. Bestel aanlyn, ontvang ons veilige posgeld betaal koevert wat veilig waarborg Gestuur.

Jy mag nie weet nie Hierdie maar ek is eintlik Chef Wonderful. Ek het lemme gemaak deur Japannese kunstenaars wat eens samoerai swaarde gemaak het. My die duurste is nou $ 3500. Kevin jy het meer rommel in jou huis as wat ek dit eintlik skerp maak met 'n klip wat twee verskillende het digthede daarop. Maar ons sal jou Monsters. uit met die monsters en Ek dink, jy weet, ons wil 'n bietjie pret h\u00ea voordat ons begin praat oor die besigheid en regtig die emosie om dit te gebruik. Ek sal dit probeer. Is die handigste met 'n jagmes Soos buite? Ek sal doen. Ek sal buite doen. Fyn. Wat Ons wou illustreer hier is almal weet hoe dit sny as u 'n super skerp mes het en hoe maklik dit gaan. Moenie dit doen nie by die huis, Kevin, As jy met 'n dowwe mes sou begin, Ek wil h\u00ea jy moet deur die Pynappel. Het dit reg deur die Sentrum. Dit is baie moeilik om te doen met 'n dowwe nag. En jy sien, dit is nie baie lekker nie. jy is klaar. Dis die dowwe mes. Jy is klaar. OUKEI nou probeer ons die skerp mes. Jy moet die pynappel bestendig hou. En dan wil jy h\u00ea ek moet dit swiep? Ja, doen dit. Kyk na daardie oorwinning, Rohan. Neem die tou en jy vou dit in twee en jy vat die dowwe mes Eerste. Wat is die dowwe een? Die een wat nie skerp daarop s\u00ea nie, OUKEI. Jammer daaroor. Ek verdien daardie een. Hou dit 'n bietjie vas bietjie nader aan die tou daar sodat dit ontglip jou nie. Ja Dis nie. En hennep is baie moeilik om sny in elk geval. Nou moet ek met die skerp lessenaar gaan? O Ek sien. Ek bedoel, , Ek bespeur die aksente. Goed , Kom ons begin daar. Ek en Mark het getrek na die VSA om hierdie besigheid te begin. Ons het 'n geslaagde gebou w\u00eareldwyd handelsmerke en besighede. Waar het jy? beweeg hier van? Ek werk uit Swede. Beide. Ek is oorspronklik van Amerika. Ek het grootgeword in Swede. En verhuis na Amerika. OUKEI. En wat Was jou beste produk wat jy verkoop het? Ek het Happy Socks gestig. Gelukkige sokkies. Ek is mal daaroor. Ja. Ek was jy. Ja. Jy is steeds betrokke by Happy Sous? Ja Ek is. Maar ek is nie operasioneel nie Nie. Ek is op die raad en eienaar. Maar hoe het jy met die mes idee self? Ons het iets terug in ons land gesien dit was soortgelyk, maar na meer na die kommersi\u00eble kant. En ons dink oor hoekom word dit nie gedoen vir 'n verbruiker en vereenvoudig dit. Kry 'n Koevert Kry die messe in vaste prys. Vinnige Draai om. Hoeveel vra jy? gaan lei ons deur. Ons sou skerp gemiddeld $ 10 per mes vir alles ingesluit minimum pakket 4 messe. Maak dit saak die Grootte? Asof hulle getand is. Daar is een van die broodmes, jy weet, Dit is wat ons vereenvoudig het. Die tradisionele lewenswinkel is in 'n boere mark. Hulle sal duim gaan en hulle vra anders. Ons het het dit baie eenvoudig gemaak. Dis per lem. Maak nie saak die grootte nie. Dit doen nie maak saak die grootte tot groot. Presies. En selfs 'n sk\u00ear, dis 'n kombuissk\u00ear. Sk\u00ear gaan in hul jag lekker visvang sk\u00ear ook. Ouens Ek is 'n bietjie verward. Iets is pla my, . Jy, Michael, is duidelik 'n suksesvolle Entrepreneur jy het natuurlik 'n redelike bietjie gemaak van geld. Hoekom soek jy hier? geld as jy 'n soort mooi het groot stapel vol al? Ek het voorheen misluk op die VSA Mark. Ons het nog 'n handelsmerk aan die gang gehad in die Amerikaanse mark sonder met Amerikaanse mense betrokke by die besigheid, met die fondse insameling en hoe jy dryf eintlik die groei van die Amerikaanse mark. Ek gaan nie doen nie weer daardie fout. Ons het twee uitgesit Strategie\u00eb. \u00d3f ons gaan waag kapitaal en kry waagkapitaal befondsde transaksie daarop of ons gaan alles Amerikaans oor wat ons gesien het as die volledig op Amerikaanse wys hoe jy bereik uit en die krag van die tenk. Watter deel van hierdie mark het u nodig? om te verstaan? Daar is boodskappe amper, dit is regtig die verpakking van die produk, hoe om dit te kommunikeer, dis kanaalstrategie. Presies wat is jou verkope? ons is op 120 aan hierdie kant van die jaar 120, 000. Hoe het u die verkope gekry? regtig, ek bedoel, Wat ons gedoen het, is hoofsaaklik Eksperimentering. Ons is nou op die 4de herhaling van ons webwerf. dit is soort van 'n bewys van konsep verkope wat ons tans doen. Ons gebruik, ons gebruik Facebook, Instagram, Google. Hoeveel het jy laas gedoen Maand? 37,037 duisend. Alles reg Luister Ek gaan jou 'n aanbod gee. Ek soos die konsep. Jy is vars, jy is uniek, jy is anders. Jy het reeds die verpakking af. Dit is regtig redelik goed. Ek dink jy is slim en moet weet wat die mark hier is. Daar is niemand wat van beter weet nie ek voel as wat ek dink ek ken iemand wie weet van beter. Nee daar is niemand wat weet nie Beter. Maar ek gaan. Dit is 'n riskante aanbod, OUKEI? Ek bedoel Ek het geen idee hoe dit gaan nie Gaan. Ek gaan jou net 'n pamflet. Jy kan dit neem of verlaat. Ek gaan vir jou 200 gee. Ek gaan jou 200 as 'n lyn gee van krediet en ek wil 20% h\u00ea. Ek bedoel As jy wil h\u00ea iemand moet jou net gee kontant, wonderlik, maar as jy wil h\u00ea iemand moet vir jou gee hulle verstand, hulle hart, hulle siel en die maal dit uit, Dis ek. Wel voor ons ja, kanaal strategie, kom ons bevolk dit net beter. 'N bietjie daaroor. Jy weet Ek dink dat digitale strategie, Dit is duidelik dat ons weet wat ons doen en hoe om te bekom. Ek glo regtig dat daar baie te doen het met fisiese kleinhandel. Wat bedoel jy fisiese kleinhandel? Ons kon dit uitsit. Hierdie Kleinhandelaars U wil h\u00ea dat hulle die diens moet verkoop en jy deel dit net. en William Sonoma, hulle het 'n bordjie opgesit en hulle s\u00ea het jou mes geslyp deur meshulpmiddels. Jy betaal Williams Sonova, jy weet, 25% daarvan en jy probeer om alles te kry kleinhandelaar nie net bereid om en dit is handelsmerkbou omdat hulle moet ons hul e-pos gee en dan betaal ons dit ook teen geld. Justin dis net 'n sekonde. Ek kan net wees soos om 'n kontak te kies, enige kontak. Ek het dit in elke enkele een van ons weet dit. Dit is hoekom ons hier is. En jy vra ons hoekom Ons is hier. Daarom is ons hier om jou 'n aanbod te maak. OUKEI Ek het dieselfde kontakte, maar ek het iets wat sy nie het nie h\u00ea. Ek is Chef Wonderful. Sjef Wonderlik is groot in koeke, sjokolade en vleis. Google hom. Hy is fantasties en ek hou daarvan om te merk goed in die kombuis. Ek sal kry agter hierdie produk 'want ek hou daarvan Baie. Hier is my aanbod, ek sal jou 400 gee, 000 vir 20%. Ek dink dit is 'n wonderlike idee omdat jy Chef Wonderful kry Ouens twee is altyd beter as een. wanneer jy die koningin van kleinhandel kry en dan sit jy dit saam, die koning van branding, Ek bedoel dit is nogal die paring. Ons wil ook graag vir jou 400 gee, maar 20% van die maatskappy, jy kry 2 haaie in plaas van 1. Self aangestel Sjef wonderlik. My handelsmerke kom in meer Amerikaners se hande as enigiemand anders in die paneel. Wag. Ek dink jy is baie aggressief in wat jy vra, maar ek hou van gulsige mense, ek en Kevin, Ons bied u $ 500,000 aan. Vir 20%. Ons is besig om die voorsprong te verhoog. As hulle wil Meeding Gaan voort. Maar ons is die regte span Vir jou. Daar is geen twyfel oor Dit. Jy weet Hier is die ding. Soms kan jy neem meer geld, maar dit beteken nie dat jy kry wat jy regtig nodig het. Dit maak sin. Wonderlike. Dit is wat jy nodig het. As ek kon vervul dit vir jou. Ons wil vinnig ry. Ons het die motor, Ons weet hoe om dit te skaal. Ons weet wat ons doen. En ons het nodig iemand s\u00ea neem daardie roete, dis vinniger. Neem daardie roete, dis vinniger. Wat ek doen, wat ons dit gedoen het, kom ons s\u00ea. Ja Ons wil almal 'n paar bou. Julle ouens wil dit 'n DTC-onderneming maak. Dit is 'n ekwiteitsmodel. Jy gaan meer kontant moet insamel. Om ons aan boord te kry, beteken dat die grootste waagkapitalistiese vallei goddelose waardasie gaan betaal. Soek oor by Markus. ek het 'n vraag. Wag jy vir Markus om vir jou te gee 'n aanbod? Nee Ek voel net baie energie kom van daardie kant van die kamer af. Maar soos, Ek weet nie wat aangaan nie. Jy gevra oor accelerant. Wat doen jy beskou as die accelerant wat Jy benodig? Ons wil net sterker uitreik h\u00ea. Ons het beter boodskappe nodig, nog duideliker boodskappe. daar is verskillende maniere om dit te doen, nie waar nie? Jy kan dit koop en dit is jou SEO, Regs? En dan is daar PR. Presies. En Dis reg. Daarom vra ek die vraag omdat sosiale, sosiale PRI beteken al die gratis verkeersbronne, di\u00e9 wat ons regtig wil doen. Ek dink ek is sterker as die ander want ek kan by enige media instap uitlaat en tel dit op, hanteer aanlyn wie ek wil. Maar Ek sal julle 'n besluit laat neem hier om te sien of hierdie transaksies is wat jy wil of nie en ek sal net wag. Wie sou s\u00ea? Ek voel regtig passievol oor want dit is al waarin ek gespring het Eerste. Het iemand anders spandeer 4000 dollar? Dis eg. Ek weet hoe om te skaal Omdat jy baie besighede het jy is by baie betrokke. Ons het dus nodig om te weet dat die persoon wat stap Aan boord saam met ons gaan eintlik om ons een uur meer te gee as die ander splinternuwe goed en dis Belangrik. $ 4000 op 'n lem, dis nie jou teikenmark nie. Ons is gaan hier 'n punt maak, Michael. Ons gaan jou 'n Oproep. Gesels net vinnig. Ja Ons het 30 sekondes. Dankie. Tim, julle is genoeg. Hoekom maak jy nie 'n aanbod nie? Ek is nie daarbo om te doen wat dit ook al is nie Neem. My. Hulle vat te lank. Jy moet kry hulle terug. Verskoon my? Ek het gedink dit is teen die re\u00ebls. Nee, daar is geen re\u00ebls nie, weet jy? Verskoon my Ouens. Jy wil weet van passie, Regs? Goed Ek sit nie en wag nie. Ek wil dit h\u00ea Deal. Ek is hier. Ek is by jou. OUKEI vir ons, ons wil jou regtig vra om beweeg tot 500 vir 20% omdat dit sal beter voel vir ons uitstap van hier met die wete dat ons dieselfde soos ander ouens. Hoekom nie? Ek kan nie eens hoor wat aangaan nie Nou. En regtig, doen elke filmvervaardiging, Ek dink ten minste, Gaan weg. Nee. Wat het ons nodig? Wat het ons nodig? Lori, Ek sal jou ondersteun. Ek is mal oor jou deal. En Ek dink ek en Barbara, julle weet wat? Boonop is ons alles ongeveer $ 100, 000. Ons het hierheen gekom met die teiken van Laurie en Ronan, maar ek wil h\u00ea hulle moet tot 500 styg. Wat het my gestuur en Markus sal uitstap Hier. Maar wag, Ek neem 'n uitdeelstuk. Wag. Kom ons gaan Kom ons gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons Gaan. Kom ons gaan. Kom ons sluit. Kom ons Maak dit toe. Kom ons maak dit toe. Nee dis naby. Ek's jammer. Ek kon het vir jou 'n ekstra 100 000 gekry. Met vier haaie wat agter ons aanhardloop in die gange is iets wat ek sou nooit droom nie en ek was soos, Ek weet nie wat aangaan nie. Die sleutel was dat hy die 100 wou h\u00ea en as sodra ek klaar ges\u00ea het, dit was asof daar geen debat was nie. Dit is 'n nuwe haairas wat bossies.\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** 15%, 20%, 25% (PERCENT), 'n week, jaar 120 (DATE), haaie, Amerikaanse, Sonoma, koeke, jou SEO (GPE), baie (LAW), Swede, Sjef (NORP), fisiese kleinhandel, baie (FAC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** kom ons gaan, jy weet, ek bedoel, kom ons, my naam, ek sal, baie moeilik, maar ek\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 die: geleentheid\n  \u2022 die: waarom rede ons\n  \u2022 posgeld: waarborg Gestuur\n  \u2022 eens: gemaak swaarde samoerai het\n  \u2022 meet: die monsters\n  \u2022 die: Sentrum\n  \u2022 die: dowwe mes\n  \u2022 die: skerp mes\n  \u2022 die: bestendig pynappel hou\n  \u2022 die: mes dowwe Eerste\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.25)\n\n**Topics:** ons, dit, het, nie, die",

    "transcript": "MEETING TRANSCRIPT:\nVolgende is 'n moderne weergawe van 'n belangrike gesondheidsbykomstigheid. Haai Haaie, my naam is Justin Wang. Ek is hier vandag om te vra vir $ 500, 000 vir 1% van my maatskappy lark. Het jy al ooit opgemerk dat funky reuk kom van jou herbruikbare waterbottel? Ek wed dat jy het. En as jy soos die meeste mense, Jy doen wat ons die snuiftoets noem. Woo wee. Die gemiddelde herbruikbare water bottel bevat meer bakterie\u00eb kolonie as jou hondebak of toiletsitplek. Geen wonder hulle stink nie. En dit is nie wonder dit is aanloklik om na te gryp 'n eenmalige plastiekwaterbottel. Die gevolg? Meer as een miljoen van hierdie ouens is verteer elke minuut, en dit is nie goed vir jou gesondheid nie en nog erger vir die omgewing. Daarom het ons die Lark uitgevind Bottel. Die Lark Bottle is die W\u00eareld se eerste selfreinigende water bottel wat water onderweg suiwer. Met 'n eenvoudige druk van 'n knoppie en net 60 sekondes, die Lark Bottle aktiveer ons gepatenteerde UV C LED-tegnologie, Suiwer afgrond om 99,99% van skadelike en reuk wat bakterie\u00eb veroorsaak, virusse en vorm. Die resultate? Suiwer water uit 'n ongerepte skoongemaakte Bottel. haaie. Vir baie. Wil net wees Duidelik. Ek het jou behoorlik gehoor. 500, 000 vir 1%. Dis korrek. Robert Geluk. Die hoogste waardasie ooit aangevra in die Haai tenk. Jy lyk soos 'n redelike mens. Vertel ons hoekom dit is terloops, in al 50 minute. Ek het 'n paartjie hiervan. O jy doen goed. Jy doen. Dit is Wonderlik. Ek doen. Maar wat is die mark geleentheid wat dit regverdig? Dit is dus 'n groot mark. Groot water is 'n regte ding. Dit is 'n $ 300 miljard mark w\u00eareldwyd. Van watter herbruikbare mark is slegs 7%? Dit groei. Ek het probeer sweer van eenmalige plastiekwaterbottel 'n paar jaar gelede. Ek het verskeie gekoop redelike opsies en seker genoeg hulle beland agter in die kas waar my gym sak hulle sou versamel vorm. As dit in my kar gesit het, was dit sou stink. dis die self skoonmaak deel. Dit lyk vir my of jy 'n UV het lig in die bokant. Kan jy verduidelik Hoe dit werk en wat dit doen? Dit is eintlik 'n optiese stelsel dit is ontwerp om die UV te weerspie\u00ebl lig binne. eenvoudig, jy druk hierdie knoppie, die UV-lig skakel aan. My medestigter is 'n PhD in fisika van Caltech. Hy het dit ontwerp om na te bons optiese lig regdeur die bottel. dan hoeveel minute doen dit neem om dit te doen? Ons het twee modusse. Ons normale modus is 60 sekondes, en dan het ons 'n waagmodus, wat 3 minute is. as jy wil om dit na 'n ontwikkelende land te neem of kamp of jy is net iewers waar jy nie heeltemal die water, Justin, Is dit veiliger as kookwater? Dit sou die ekwivalent van kookwater vir 20 minute. Regtig. Kompetisie. Is jy die net een wat UV het? Aktivering en skoonmaak, ons het in Oktober 2018 bekendgestel. Ons was die eerste een op die mark. Ons het ongeveer 10 patente, beide nut en ontwerp hier rondom produk en ander produkte. Maar daar is kopies daar buite wat ons streef na potensi\u00eble reg aksies vir nou. Justin, Waarom is dit $ 50 miljoen werd? Daarom het ons hierdie produk in 2018 bekendgestel. ons was op die mark vir 'n klein, amper twee jaar, onder twee jaar. En in ons eerste volle jaar in 2019, ons het 'n bietjie meer as vyf en 'n half gedoen, $ 1,000,000 in verkope. In die laaste 12 maande, Ons het meer as $ 9 miljoen gedoen. Hierdie jaar beplan ons om $ 14 te doen Miljoen. Wat jy gaan maak op die 14,000,000? het ons ons eerste buitekant gebring waagkapitaal rond vroe\u00ebr hierdie jaar in Januarie, en ons het geleun om die Besigheid. hierdie jaar is ons verwag om ongeveer $ 1,000 te verloor, 000. Justin, hoeveel het jy ingesamel? 6.7 By watter waardasie? Teen 'n waardasie van $31,7 miljoen. Kom ons praat net regte besigheid. Jy het net 6.7 ingesamel. Hoeveel kos jy het in die bank? Ek het ongeveer 6,5. OUKEI jy hoef regtig nie te spandeer nie enigiets goed vir jou, reg? Ja. Waarvoor verkoop dit? Die wyn wat jy net daar het, is 95. Ek het 95 hiervoor betaal. Al is dit, Liewe aarde dit gaan jou eintlik nie kos nie. Wat om dit te maak? Die grondkoste is ongeveer 40. Jy het ges\u00ea jy het baie patente. Wat is daardie ander produkte wat jy reeds h\u00ea? Sommige van die patente dek net 'n paar ander toepassings, maar sommige van hulle is wel van toepassing op die nuwe Produk. Dit is die groot prentjie, wat ons eerste inval in die Huis. Laat ek dit baie vinnig doen. En terwyl dit gaan, Ek sal jou 'n video wys van hoe dit Werk. Tradisionele waterfoto's gebruik 'n filter en die grootste probleem is dat hulle slegs kontaminante vang waar hulle vinnig kon ophoop en vermenigvuldig en eintlik omkeer besoedel jou water. Waarom keer hulle besoedeling om? Omdat die kontaminante word daar vasgekeer en versamel. En as kieme groei, daar is 'n nat poreuse omgewing dis donker. Stel jou dus voor al die dinge wat daar kan groei. Ons volg dus 'n tweestap-benadering. Die eerste stap, jy sien dit gaan deur en dit vang dinge soos lood, kadmium, Kwik. In die tweede stap, jy druk eenvoudig op hierdie knoppie en dit sal die water wat weg is, suiwer Deur. En soos u kan sien, dit is 'n Clearwater wat ons gooi blou water in wat besmet is Skoonwater. Maar is iemand anders doen jy dit? Niemand doen dit nie. Daar is 'n miljoen mense op planeet het nie toegang tot skoon water. En 1,5 miljoen het nie toegang tot elektrisiteit . Ek dink nie een van daardie mense nie kry nou hierdie bottel omdat hulle nie 95 dollar het nie. 1% van al ons opbrengs gaan na ons liefdadigheidsvennoot, 1% vir die planeet liefdadigheid water goed bewus waar ons putte in Afrika bou. 1% van die winste, 1% van die inkomste wat ons van bruto belowe inkomste, bruto inkomste 1%. Dit is dit is indrukwekkend van die boonste lyn af. Ek beteken jy is toegewyd. Ek kry dit. Dit is belangrik. Damon gaan om 'n spies deur jou te steek. Nee Ek kan nog, maar ek wil dit net uitl\u00ea waar Ek is OUKEI. Ek dink ons is in 'n tyd wanneer Mense is regtig kwaad. Hulle is op soek na hoop. En toe ek hierby aanmeld Platform die platform het nie begin as die rykes help die rykes met 6.5 miljoen in die bank. Ek kon net doen dit nie omdat ek net dink dat ek om 'n ander rede hier is. Ek dink dit is mal. Ek sal die ander haaie bespreek dit, maar ek is uit. Ek kom ook van 'n agtergrond waar ek nie baie gehad het nie. Dit is jammer dat u dit nie sal neem nie reis saam met my, maar ek respekteer wat jy s\u00ea, Laat ek dus 'n kans daarop neem. Ek ondersteun 'n liefdadigheidsorganisasie genaamd One Drop, om seker te maak dat almal kan drink vars water regoor die w\u00eareld. Iets wat ek agter kan kom. Hou daarvan om hierby betrokke te wees, maar ek doen dit nie vir 1% nie. Ek breek te veel waarde. Ek het nog nooit 'n handel vir 1% om voor die hand liggende redes. Ek sal dit vir 4% doen. Ek gee nie om hoe nie jy struktureer dit, adviesaandele, Wat. jy wil h\u00ea hy moet dit doen byna 'n derde van sy laaste Ronde? Ek het nie ges\u00ea jy sal daarvan hou nie, Markus, of jy sou. Ek s\u00ea net vir jou wat ek sou doen. Is daar ander bied daar buite of jy weet, om u 'n halwe $ 1,000,000 vir 1% te gee? Ek voel asof ek niks maak nie. Die kategorie waarin ons is, is reusagtig, die $ 300 miljard-industrie, en dit is ryp vir ontwrigting en ryp vir innovasie. Ek dink ek is gaan aanbiedinge neem en luister na Lori. Ek sal graag saam met jou wil werk. Ek sal daarvan hou 500,000 vir 5%. Jy hou aan om agteruit te gaan, Justin. Justin, die probleem met 1% is dat u geprys word vir perfeksie. En ja, Ek sal graag 1% van Apple wil besit en Ek sal graag 1% van Tesla wil besit, Maar die kans is net laag. Om maak dit makliker vir jou beleggers, Ek sal 500 doen, 000 vir 3%. Ons kan die ander 2% vir uit jou adviespoel. Dis my aanbod. En Markus, is jy enige plek? Ja Ek weet waar ek is. kyk, daar is verskillende platforms vir verskillende redes, nie waar nie? Dit is 'n plek waar mense kom waar hulle net 'n bietjie nodig het meer brandstof. Hulle het 'n bietjie hulp nodig. Ons is nie hier om maatskappye te evalueer nie Dit kan miljard dollar se verkope wees meer as 'n triljoen dollar mark in 20 jare, wat moontlik is, Maar dit is nie die plek om dit te doen nie. om daardie redes, Ek is uit. Dit is dus drie aanbiedinge. Wat wil jy doen? Jy weet die aanbiedinge is almal wonderlik, maar selfs sonder die adviesaandele onder my laaste waardasie van 32 ish, Regs? Om eerlik met jou te wees, dis regtig my uiteinde. Wat oor ons het julle almal ingekry vir half $ 1, 000,000 elk vir 'n totaal van $ 1.5 miljoen. Teen 4 1/2% en ek sal ook ingooi Adviesaandeel van 1% verdeel tussen julle drie. vir totaal, dit sou 5 1/2% vir daardie geld wees, 2%. Ja. OUKEI. Hier is iets wat ons sal doen. Sou u 1,000,000 oorweeg, 1/2 of 6% en elke haai kry 2? As jy 3 haaie kry, groot waarde vir jou. Twee haaie in die omgewing en Justin het een aanbod op die tafel van Kevin, Laurie en Robert vir sy water suiweringsmaatskappy Lark. Groot waarde vir jou. Een punt 5 500, 000 elk vir 6%. Wat s\u00ea jy? Ek kon die aanbod met een aanvaar voorwaarde dat die struktuur in 'n manier dat $ 1.5 miljoen vir 4.5% en die oorblywende 1,5% sal raadgewend wees aandele wat onder u verdeel moet word. My vraag is kry ek 2% vir my $ 500, 000? Jy doen. Hoe lank is die vesting tydperk vir die adviesaandele? 24 maande gebaseer op wat? Is jy gebaseer op? Ek dink ons het net 'n gesprek oor wat ons met die Besigheid hoe ons dit saam kon bou. Miskien is dit QVC, miskien is dit hulle maak dit baie eenvoudig. Dit is te ingewikkeld. Jy weet wat Ek is uit, want ek het regtig gewerk moeilik om by hierdie punt uit te kom. Ek doen dit nie het jy nodig om 'n onderhoud met my te voer. Ek wil nie gebeurlikhede daarop h\u00ea nie. Weet dat ons betrokke gaan wees. Ons wil dit nie net sien nie verdamp. Absoluut Absoluut. Ek is in vir 2% vir 500, 000. Ek sal $ 1,000 doen, 000 vir 4% verdeel tussen jou en Laurie. Ek is in geen advies nie. Dis net reguit advies sou net groot, geen gebeurlikhede nie. half $ 1, 000, 000 elk vir 1,5% plus 'n halwe persent in adviesaandele, 2% totaal. Ek wil nie advies h\u00ea nie Aandele. Ek hou van, kan jy dit doen? Kyk Ek wil haar vir seker deel van die ooreenkoms h\u00ea. Ek sien baie waarde hier. Wat dit neem om haar aan boord te kry, Ek wil dieselfde h\u00ea. sit jy 'n paal in die sand hier op die ja, Ek sal 2% gaan. , wel, Dit is wat ons moet doen. Maar nie advies aandele.

City we are seeking 125 000 investment for five percent of our company whoa sharks who doesn't love pizza as we all know there are Pizza Lovers all over the world Pizza is delicious but when you think of frozen pizza you don't think of it as an appetizer or a high quality Gourmet snack and let's be honest it can be hard to eat those delicious slices on the go plus the frozen pizza snacks category has gone a bit stale but that is until now sharks meet the pizza cupcakes it's your birthday [Music] that's it get the hell out of here the pizza cupcake is the next level of pizza that belongs anywhere and everywhere a fine Gourmet snack that's easy to serve and made with high quality ingredients plus our trade secret dough recipe delivers a fluffy texture that's unlike any pizza you've ever had and because of its cupcake shape and size the pizza cupcake is perfect for any occasion and can be enjoyed in even more ways and places than your traditional slice sharks who's ready to take a bite of the pizza Cupcake Stop talking let's eat yes if we dig in which one should we try those are our two best sellers the margarita and the pepperoni the margarita is the vegetarian pepperoni as it's one of the wow Americans favorites and the sauce is yours the sauces our sauce is the marinara sauce that we made before we came in it's delicious good thank you I hate you because I want to eat these is now your regular pizza dough it's a it's a hybrid it's good flaky paste there's got to be a lot of butter in this exactly no there is no butter what only olive oil it's a hybrid between a brioche and a Sourdough you get the fluffiness of the brioche and then you get the crunchy how old is this it tastes you made it this morning that's a frozen product New York City yeah marinara sauce is our favorite good Kevin to be silent and be eating is amazing good and it's 160 calories for the margarita for one yes for one and 170 for the pepperoni Andrea tell us your background how did you come up with this magic born and raised in Venice Italy and I work in the kitchen as a chef since I was 16 and I moved to London to learn English when it was 19 years old and in London I worked for one of the fine Italian restaurants that is owned by one of the largest private members Club in the in the world Soho Soho House yeah and they gave me the opportunity to move to New York in 2006 to open one of their members club and I spent 10 years doing that until I met Michelle how did you meet Michelle we met through a mutual friend and it was funny because he asked me out on a pizza date and I said Pizza day no man has ever asked me out for a pizza but the twist was he wanted to teach me how to make pizza I'm sure he did and I had to show off yeah he had to show off and we've been married for almost two years now and this is our first baby congratulations I was an event producer and then I worked with social media influencers and how did you go from this incredible product you're making to launching the business walk us through that there was one event that we did that it was for our best friends that it was all a group of Italian people and everybody loved it and Italians are picky I was afraid but they all loved it and she with her background she was we need to bring this to my events and see what the reaction is and that's how we started how do you sell it yeah now we sell direct to consumer but last year our three distribution channels were catering Smorgasburg which is New York City's most popular Market that gave us the street cred to have that proof of concept and then we also did stadium our first partnership was with Citi Field home of the New York Mets and they approached us did you get a commercial kitchen involved yes we produced in a commercial kitchen and we also have a co-packer who we've been working with for the last nine months Laura you might be familiar with her co-packer we definitely sought them out because their biggest client is Bantam Bagel yes but what will sales be this year this year we're projecting a hundred thousand dollars in sales nice we did 344 000 in Revenue last year year to date we've done seventy seven thousand dollars but we have a plan and we know how to execute our plan prior to covid we were a restaurant business and because of the seasonality of our business we knew that we had to launch e-commerce direct to customer Frozen frog correct yes direct to customer we we knew that was in the road map because currently we're New York City Base our customers are from all around the country and they wanted to know where they could find us I learned something with Wicked Good Cupcakes yes the first royalty deal in Shark Tank history paid its millionth dollar to me in royalties wow fantastic but the shipping Journey we took in the cost of the weight of cupcake jars made of glass we learned we had to sell six not three then we went to a dozen our goal now is to find a different fulfillment center who can service one in the midwest one in the Northeast and one in the South but what do you charge Michelle what is this 12-pack is 24.99 and how much is shipping 9.99 it's three bucks five dollars to get 12 credits three bucks a cupcake what does it cost you to make these one cupcake is 95 cents at the moment that's expensive yeah that's expensive it is expensive because we're making it by hand in our commercial kitchens the recipe that we have allow us to go to 48 cents per cupcake and that's why we're here for your investment we can start production with our co-packers you're starting up you haven't even figured out yet how it's all going to come together in terms of shipping a frozen product I think you're going to have some significant challenges there's no question about it good luck to you I'm out thank you thank you here's where I'm at guys I'm not even going to get into the valuation because you could be optimistic I think that I don't know if I'd be the greatest partner as soon as I saw this I was this is Bantam Bagels in another category I know other people up here who have stadiums and a bunch of buddies with stadiums yeah with no one showing up now but they will sooner or later eventually yes I wish you all the best but in the best interest of being a good shark for you I'm not the best partner up here I'm out thank you thank you Damon look I'm torn I think you're going to get a better offer than I probably would have made you but man you guys are the real deal I'm out thank you thank you first off I think it's amazingly delicious listen you're from Venice and you're from New York you guys know what you're doing when it comes to Pizza I'm gonna make you an offer because I think there's great Synergy with my Bantam Bagels company Banning Bagels as started with a stuffed Bagel ball and we got into Starbucks Nationwide and then we got into all the major grocery stores freezer sections that might be fun for them to also be involved I'm going to make you an offer I'm going to offer you 125 000 but for 20 percent Mamma Mia [Music] three sharks are out Michelle and Andrea have an offer on the table from Lori for their business the pizza cupcake but she wants a bigger slice of the pie than the five percent they came in offering I'm gonna offer you 125 000 but for twenty percent Mamma Mia what we can bring to the table is worth it I think that we can help you to Skyrocket I'll be and no it's not at all it's a great offer I could have gone higher you have an offer that's pretty interesting yes you can travel in our footsteps of every single distribution channel that we have Mark yeah guys look if you want to stay frozen working with Bantam is the way to go here's the thing selling Frozen is hard as Lori will tell you as we've all done getting into space is hard getting it to deliver at a reasonable price is hard and for those Reasons I'm out but congratulations guys thank you thank you much you're left with Lori and yes no Lori 20 is too high for us I feel we've already gone through a lot of challenges we found the co-packer which I think is the most difficult part would you be willing to do 125 000 for 10 percent we we work hard you wouldn't have to a lot of heavy lifting we have investors on board who are also strategic we've been in conversations with one of the largest Distributors now who wants us to participate in their incubator program to get us into retail I know the time and effort and all of that that we will put in I know you're going to do the heavy lifting but I know that I will also be opening many doors for you if I can get you into Starbucks Nationwide that's 9 000 locations and then getting into Kroger Albertsons it will be worth it to you I will not go to 10 percent my bottom line my bottom line would be 15. [Music] would you do 125 000 for 12 and a half percent Lori please what I love you but listen you will love me 15. I got it you want me to be invested in you would you be willing to go up to a hundred fifty thousand dollars for 15 percent 125 15 and I promise you you will not regret it Bantam Bagel you invested at a 1.1 million dollar valuation when they were on the show and we have higher Revenue than them we've also have figured out our co-packer situation we also have we're shipping through go Michelle it's to stick to your girl I know what you guys I completely I completely understand it but here's something you don't know you said you were learning the road what I know is is that there's much more for you to learn the thing that is invaluable is learning experience I had no Mentor I had to figure out everything for myself but I do know that somebody could come and sit with me for one day and I could save them two years worth of time of mistakes guys you sound Shark Tank your numbers I got that but you also know something else about Shark Tank when you only have one offer yes you're skating on thin ice yes and now you have to make a decision no I know can I make one more counter offer you can do whatever you would you be willing to do 125 000 for 12 and a half percent and then two and a half in advisory shares Lori what do you say you got it yeah congratulations guys shark hug congratulations thank you thank you much thank you much make sure my pizza is at my house by this weekend Arriva their cheek Pizza Guys we're living that American dream where we have our family business we have our Dream shark on our team and we can start scaling and having pizza cupcakes as a household brand wait you're not subscribed to the Shark Tank Youtube channel then for that reason I'm out\n\nNLP FEATURES:\n**Entities:** Americans, Italian, Italians, American (NORP), this morning, 12 and a half percent (TIME), English (LANGUAGE), Soho Soho House, Bantam Bagels (FAC), first (ORDINAL), midwest, Northeast, South (LOC)\n\n**Key Phrases:** the pizza cupcake, the margarita, a lot, new york city, the world, the pepperoni, a hybrid, a frozen product\n\n**Action Patterns:**\n  \u2022 deliver: texture\n  \u2022 thank: you\n  \u2022 hate: you\n  \u2022 be: butter\n  \u2022 tell: background\n  \u2022 give: opportunity\n  \u2022 spend: years\n  \u2022 ask: me\n  \u2022 get: kitchen\n  \u2022 do: 344 000\n\n**Sentiment:** Positive (polarity: 0.22)\n\n**Topics:** pizza, shark, cupcake, percent, year",

a 200 000 investment for five percent of our company imagine a peaceful day on the road wind blowing sun shining you're bumping your favorite track cruising down the back streets catching a Vibe but then that smell hits you a nearby landfill spilled coffee even forgotten french fries can turn your car from an oasis into a horrible stinky nightmare for years the problem of a stinky ride has been solved by a series of ugly and unstylish air fresheners we created ride fresh the world's finest air freshener brand I know you guys are probably wondering why paper air fresheners when you do a little sniffing around you'll figure out that it's an untapped Market at ridefresh we offer a subscription-based car air freshener brand with unique scents and Designs that'll be sure to blow you and your customers mods we have amazing scents wood grain wow eucalyptus I love this one bro nice and even your favorite basketball teams this one smells winning sorry Mark the reality is is that paper air freshers have had no innovation in far too long and they smell whack hey bro what's up I think I'm smelling the deal with the help of the Sharks we can make ride fresh explode a series of all fresh scents please feel free to crack them open and enjoy wow wow after that Mark are you you're still over there what how much marketing move ever I'm out what that's it seriously seriously you got to read the room wrong move wrong time what are you upset about yeah why what do you think the one air pressure from the NBA is the team that beats Us in the NBA Conference Finals gotta know that cut it out yeah I could be but I'm not wow here's one thing I'll shout out before I even opened them I picked them up and I could smell the scents I was wow these are obviously packed with the fragrance we pride ourselves on having some traditional scents some non-traditional scents but our entire approach and our entire brand is adding a cool factor to the air freshener and changing the experience you sell any of this stuff in retailers at all subscription direct to Consumer online we built our business off of direct to Consumer online we proved the concept to the tune of over 1.1 million dollars in sales and then what thank you thank you how much time in three years let's talk about one year this year what are you going to do in this year in sales this year we're going to do over 750 000 But to answer your original question Mr Wonderful we've always known that the subscription was the first phase of our building our business but the main potential and the biggest potential for us is in retail and wholesale why would you say that have you proven that or have you started down that Alleyway gas stations things that things where it's intuitive to pick this up exactly in the in the last six months we've been able to get to the final stages of an agreement with the largest Automotive retailer in the country what's the deal for two thousand dollars two thousand of their six thousand locations in other words they're going to order from you how many dollars of merchandise 2.1 million dollars in 2023. it's Pep Boys that thing yeah it's AutoZone what did you sell last year last year we sold 5440 000 and out of that 540 was any retail it was at all subscriptions why does somebody buy a subscription model for an air freshener for their car yeah it's a convenience factor think ride share drivers taxi drivers these types of individuals if I started with you how long before I cancel about four months and how long how much subscription they range the base one is you get two a month and we have them in pairs and that's 8.25 with shipping and then the highest one yeah and the highest one is 10.99 38 cents is our cost landed out of the 540 000 you did last year were you profitable yes yes what did you make 40 000 in profit wow 40 000. what were you guys doing before this yeah why are you here we're brothers we're lifelong entrepreneurs in 2014 we launched the first mobile app for black and brown emojis before they Diversified the set my brother has a successful career in sales and I was at a couple different ad agencies in my career we both went to Howard University the Howard University I then came to Los Angeles and then I got my Master's at USC in entrepreneurship Innovation and as as a certified in technology commercialization I remember walking down the street and seeing all these air freshers everywhere in everybody's car and I was listen if we put some culture and style on top of this thing I already know that this Market is 11 billion dollars worldwide in the United States is 300 million yeah we could definitely do this because there's nobody doing a subscription model that's the most interesting thing you've said in this pitch the air freshener Market is 300 million yeah it's interesting and this is male skewed I think you need work here in that I think you need to have an entire female based line because I wouldn't hang this shape in my car it's not the investment for me but I wish you good luck thank you much you guys are the real deal I've been trying to get my head around investing in you when I was younger my mom and dad put me in the back of a car with a million suitcases and everything had to sit in the back for 24 hours no because my dad refused to pay for a motel we had to drive from Toronto all the way to Florida all I could see was the air freshener it is scorched into my brain as soon as I see air fresheners I think I never want to go back there I'm sorry I can't be in I'm out there but let me tell you where I'm stuck at the numbers no one's brought this up yet I don't know why two hundred thousand dollars for five percent four million valuation on a business that makes no money this is a business model not yet fine-tuned I'm out I think you need to be congratulated for producing seven hundred thousand dollars in sales it's amazing online amazing why are pivoting that you're going into retail I think you're out of your mind I don't think you realize cash intensive it is why did you pivot to retail I'm curious because that was all that was always the plan and in the last year the main way that we were able to grow the subscriptions and acquire those subscribers became a lot more expensive you were losing heart in your subscription model because the numbers had changed yes but we were always going to focus on growing the business through retailer wholesale all I'm going to be making an offer contingent on your big deals I'll take a flyer on this because I believe in the two of you I'll make you the offer of course the 200 000 but I do want 25 of business [Applause] smells a lot let me can I ask a question yes are there other ways that you can help us in terms of a strategic partnership in exchange for maybe 15 for their 200k I would have to say 15 definitely not I think this is going to be a lot of work to sell this thinking about 200k for 20. what for 20 contention on those two big things on those two deals you got it thank you thank you guys thank you you better not lose my money thank you much thank you and sorry again are we I'm sorry it's all good it's all good congrats guys I think Barbara saw true entrepreneurs grit grind tenacity we were already trending upwards with these major retail and wholesale deals the trades been able to secure and

Ja u verwyder hierdie enigste ondersteuning Gedeelte. Gryp dit net, draai en trek dan uit. Nou is jy reg. OUKEI die hele stuk is deels af dat jy net daar uitgehaal. Dis die verwyderbare enigste ondersteuning. Dit is regtig die kern van ons IP. Daar was verwyderbare hakke voor, ja, maar niemand is ooit innoverend nie, ek gaan hieroor opstaan. O Wow. Dit is soos springlewendigheid. Ja. om sit hulle weer aan, jy haak net hierdie bietjie hier, pop dit weer in, gee dit 'n draai, dit sal klik en jy is teruggesluit op sy plek. Gotcha. ek neem aan dat jy 'n hele paar van Hierdie? Ons het Ja. dit was 'n jaar en 'n paar Verander en ons het 'n bietjie meer as $ 800 gedoen, 000 in verkope. En wat is die wat is die opbrengste soos? Jip. ons terugkeer en ruil persentasie is 24 persent. 24, Ja. Die skoene is egter gemiddeld is 20%, net omdat die grootte vir skoene is moeilik. En u verkope is netto verkope na almal lewer geen netto verkope nie, 500, 500 duisend. OUKEI elke vrou wat ek ken, haat haar hoog hakke, elkeen van hulle, en kan nie meer as in hulle wandel nie drie of vier uur. Hoekom was dit jy wie het ges\u00ea laat ek iets doen aan Hierdie? in my tweede jaar op universiteit, Ek was uit by 'n sororiteitsveer formeel en ek het 6 duim hoog gedra hakke soos universiteitsmeisies doen. Maar hoog hakke as jy probeer dans is nie gemaklik nie. Dit is regtig meer van 'n wankel. En ek wou bors 'n skuif. ek het haar my ho\u00eb hakke en na die dans geneem vloer kaalvoet, ongelukkig. Tragedie en inspirasie nogal letterlik een van die ander getref jong vroue het haar per ongeluk gestamp stiletto deur my voet en vasgedruk ek deur die toon. My god deur die toon. Soos reg deur. En terwyl ek aan die kant van die dansvloer, dit het my opgeval as vreemd dat daar hierdie maatskaplike verwagting vir vroue om ho\u00eb hakke volgens formule te dra professionele geleenthede. Almal weet hulle het seer en dat hulle ongerieflik en tog is daar geen Oplossing. , Haley, hoe het jy jou $ 500, 000 in netto verkope? Ons is almal aanlyn. En ons kon deur verkoop digitale bemarking, PR en dan ook mondeling. Haley, jy is super indrukwekkend. Dankie. Ek wil jou agtergrond hoor a bietjie. Ja Absoluut. toe ek op universiteit was, Ek was al baie in die kopruimte van wanneer ek gradueer, Ek wil vir myself werk. En na daardie impalement insident, Ek duif eerste in kop. Begin by verskillende geleenthede en eintlik die 1ste $ 26 ingesamel, 500 en ek het eintlik die eerste werkende verkoopsman monsters die dag voor my kollege-gradeplegtigheid. hulle het hul eerste blaaskans gekry. Was jy dra jou skoene daarin gradeplegtigheid prentjie? Ja Absoluut. En gelukkig sou ek eintlik het die maatskappy genoeg opgebou hierby punt dat toe ek gegradueer het, ek was voltyds kan aangaan. Ek het gebring op 'n skoene-ontwikkelingspan, gehuur op ACO, baie student gebring Vrywilligers. Eintlik was dit $ 26, 000. Ja, aanvanklik het ons meer sin gekry as wat ek nou my maatskappy besit. ons het altesaam 2,5 miljoen ingesamel Vandag. 2,5 miljoen, alles op omskepbare note. op die oomblik ioon 83% van die maatskappy, maar nadat hulle tot bekering gekom het, dit hang natuurlik van waardasie af. Maar byvoorbeeld, as u vandag my ooreenkoms sou aangaan, Ek sou op 45% wees. O en dat ons sal moet Onderhandel. En gaan jy om uiteindelik te besit as u 'n ooreenkoms kry minder as 45%. Maar ek gaan besit 'n bietjie minder van 'n veel groter maatskappy met die hulp van 'n gesin, waarvan ek altyd 'n aanhanger is. Maar hoe baie kontant het jy oor in die Bank? Op die oomblik het ons ongeveer $ 250, 000. Hoeveel voorraad het u Op hierdie oomblik? Ek het $ 150, 000 se voorraad teen kosprys. Wat is jou maandelikse brandwond? Ons maandelikse brand op die oomblik gaan oor 90 000 voor bemarking. U brandwond is $ 90,000 per maand. Ja jy het drie maande van. Kontant oor, ja. Maar dit ges\u00ea, Ek was al voorheen in hierdie situasie en ek het daaruit gekom. Iets jy moet van my weet is ek is een van die veerkragtigste mense wat jy sal ooit ontmoet nie. Terug in 2019, ons was in 'n situasie waar ek gevind het ons $ 80,000 skuld en ek het besef, OUKEI Ek het net genoeg kontant in die bank om dit 30 dae te maak of ons is uit Besigheid. En tref ek die grond Loop. Ek het elke liewe persoon wat sou luister en ek gesluit $ 1,000, 000 transaksie op die 30ste dag. En dis hoekom ons vandag nog in besigheid is. ja, dit is 'n skrikwekkende situasie. Maar ek glo te veel hieraan. Moet dit nooit laat misluk nie en ek sal uitkom daarvan. Jy wil nie regtig gee nie meer as 5% hier styg. Ek bedoel Ek waardeer die waarde wat 'n haai bring na die tafel. Goed, kyk, Ek sal jou 'n aanbod maak wat lyk Op hierdie manier. Ek gee jou die $ 500, 000 vir 5%. Egter Ek word 'n tanti\u00e8me betaal totdat ek 1 verhaal, 000, 000 dollar en dan gaan daardie koninklikes Weg. En dan die enigste onderhandeling ons moet h\u00ea, is hoeveel dit koninklikes moet wees. Ek wil dit graag h\u00ea om $ 5 per eenheid te wees. Ek stel nie baie belang in 'n koninklikes net omdat ek elke enkele dollar om te groei Op hierdie manier. Dis belaglik. Ons weet nie eens nie wat dit kos en ons weet nie wat hulle kos om te maak. Kevin Op hierdie oomblik die produkkoste is $ 36 en dan is die grondkoste is 47, en ons verkoop dit vir tussen 1:50 en 190. Jy het genoeg plek vir 'n $ 5 koninklikes. Dit is nie 'n probleem nie. Ek doen maar ek wil eerder h\u00ea dat $ 5 gaan na groei. Jy weet nog nie, Haley. Hoekom wag jy nie om te sien hoe nie baie ander aanbiedinge wat jy kry? , Haley, laat ek die bal hier aan die gang kry. Ek dink jy is die tipe mens wat jy weet nie wat jy nie weet nie. Seker. Die belangrikste deel van die bou 'n besigheid. Hou dit in lyn en jy rek elke bok nege verskillende maniere om te sien waaruit jy sal kom Dit. En ek voel soos ons is. As ek dit doen, bedoel ek, Ek weet ons het 'n ho\u00eb brandwond, maar soos ek genoem het, Ek het nie oormatige bokoste nie. Jy het oormatige bokoste. Jy is brand $ 90, 000 per maand. Jy maak twee groot en 'n die helfte, $ 1,000, 000 en jy het drie maande oor voordat jy buite werking is. Ek sou s\u00ea dis belangrik. Ek kannie Neem 'n kans op jou besigheid daardie berge saam met jou klim. ek is jammer, nie . Dankie. Ja. Haley, jy het $ 150, 000 se voorraad. Dit gaan oor $ 500, 000 se inkomste. Dis 'n ander 5 1/2 maande van oorlewing, wat jou dan toelaat om meer te skep kontantvloei om meer voorraad in te bring. As jy vir my ges\u00ea het dit is waar ons is By Ek gaan hierdie skoene verkoop omdat ek moet my aandag hierop vestig Dinge. Om daardie skoene te verkoop, dit sou 'n ander storie wees. Maar dis nie waar jy is nie. vir daardie redes oor. OUKEI Dankie vir jou tyd. Haley. Jy is merkwaardige jong vrou. Maar die produk bekommer my 'n bietjie. Dit het baie vreemd gevoel om op te loop. Ek weet nie of ek geloop het nie verskeie blokke in die stad New York, Byvoorbeeld, tussen vergaderings, as dit regtig iets sou wees dit sou vir my gemaklik wees. Ek Weet jy gaan 'n sukses wees in die lewe. Dit word ek nie 100% verkoop nie. Ek wens jy die beste geluk, maar ek is uit. Dankie. Ek waardeer dit. Haley, Ek dink dit is slim. Dit is 'n goeie Idee. Dit is wonderlik vir QVC. Ek dink jy hou van miskien dink ek dit is goed kwaliteit, maar 500,000 vir 5% dit is net nie genoeg vir my en ek nie moenie dink 500, 000 gaan genoeg wees vir jou. Dankie. Alle paaie lei terug na mnr. Ek wed jou, Haley, as jy kon teruggaan en as jy kon dinge anders gedoen het, jy sou h\u00ea. En nou is jy 90 dae weg van die vergetelheid. Jou probleem is verkope. Dis die enigste ding wat jou gaan red. Maar hoe meer jy verkoop, hoe meer kapitaal jy vasmaak Voorraad. Dis die vloek van die skoenbedryf. Jy het geld nodig. Ek het dit, maar ek gaan myself in 'n voorkeur posisie. Ek wil regtig nie 'n koninklike doen nie. Soos ek aan my genoem het, 'n Koninklike gaan net baie wees teenproduktief vir die befondsing van groei en dit plaas my in 'n voorkeur posisie sodat ek nie mislei word in Vergetelheid. Ek wil graag teenwerk met 500,000. Vir 8%. Nee. As hier geen koninklikes is nie herwin my kabinet, Koninklikes maak jou nie dood as jy draai nie jou voorraad vinnig. Merk Ek sien nie jy skryf 'n tjek nie. Dit is die enigste ooreenkoms wat daar is Op hierdie oomblik en ek dink nie hy sal sleg wees nie. Nee Ek sal dit waarskynlik dra hakke in die hemel voor ek my 500 gekry het, 000 terug. Hoe gaan dit met ons om 'n koninklike te doen teen $ 2.50 totdat u 500 kry, 000 terug? Kyk, ek gee om vir 500 000, dis nie tjommie verandering nie. Is jy Oop vir enige soort toonbank? Jy kan alles teenwerk wat jy wil, maar ek word nie te\u00ebgewerk nie. En kom nou, jy het ges\u00ea dat jy dit verander het jaar en ewe skielik die hart in jou liggaam oorgeplant. Ek waardeer dit baie dat u my help met hierdie ooreenkoms, Lori. vir jou s\u00ea ek nee. My aanbod is baie eenvoudig. Dit is $ 5 per eenheid totdat Ek verhaal $ 1,000, 000 en ek wil die 5% ekwiteit h\u00ea en ek is die enigste haai. Dit maak van jou 'n aanbod. Is jy oop vir 'n groter belegging? No 500 is genoeg. Ek sal jou bewaar gaan vir nog ongeveer ses maande. En jy is nie oop vir 'n ander nie tanti\u00e8me struktuur? Nee. As u vyf aanbiedinge hier gehad het, myne sou nie die een wees wat jy sou h\u00ea nie Kies. Maar jy doen nie. Sou u die $ 500 doen, 000 teen 5% met 'n tanti\u00e8me van $ 3 betaal terug na die miljoen? Nee. Met alle respek, Ek dink nie ons gaan 'n handel vandag. Ek waardeer al u tyd baie en die terugvoer. Dankie. Goeie geluk, Haley. Dit is my baba. Ek het elke enkele stukkie van myself hierin vir die afgelope vier jaar. En ek sal dit elke dag aanhou doen totdat ons kom waar ek weet ons kan Gaan. Enige belegger wat sy sien, gaan om hierna te kyk en te s\u00ea: Wag \u2019n sekonde jy is 90 dae weg van die vergetelheid. Jy weet sy sal jou dalk verras.
