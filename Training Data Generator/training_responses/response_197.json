  "executiveSummary": "Alexander Simone, an inventor from San Francisco, pitched his product 'ProntoBev'—a rapid wine chiller—to the Sharks seeking $100,000 for 5% equity. After initial skepticism regarding valuation and lack of production, Kevin O'Leary offered $100,000 for 50%, which Alexander declined.
