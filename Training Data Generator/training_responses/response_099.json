  "executiveSummary": "Jeff Cranny pitched LockStraps to the Sharks, seeking $200,000 for 20% equity. He demonstrated the strength of his straps compared to traditional cable locks but struggled to provide clear sales data and financial history, particularly after a failed Home Depot order. The Sharks were concerned about his lack of active involvement in the business and unclear path forward, ultimately leading to no investment offers.",
  "keyDecisions": "No major decisions recorded; all Sharks declined to invest.",
