  "executiveSummary": "Alexander Simone, an inventor from San Francisco, pitched his product 'ProntoBev'—a rapid wine chiller capable of cooling a bottle of wine by 20° in 30 seconds—to the Sharks, seeking $100,000 for 5% equity. After several Sharks declined due to valuation concerns, Kevin O'Leary offered $100,000 for 50%, which Alexander negotiated down.
