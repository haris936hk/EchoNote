Because what kid wouldn't want to ease. Because what kid wouldn't want to ease. Because what kid wouldn't want to use a power tool like this to make use a power tool like this to make use a power tool like this to make awesome stuff like this? awesome stuff like this? awesome stuff like this? &gt;&gt; Now, the chompsaw works like a really &gt;&gt; Now, the chompsaw works like a really &gt;&gt; Now, the chompsaw works like a really fast hole punch, which intercepts fast hole punch, which intercepts fast hole punch, which intercepts cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. cardboard and chomps it off bit by bit. So, Sharks, who's ready to help So, Sharks, who's ready to help So, Sharks, who's ready to help inventors of all ages unleash their inventors of all ages unleash their inventors of all ages unleash their creative potential and cut a deal with creative potential and cut a deal with creative potential and cut a deal with the chomp saw? the chomp saw? the chomp saw? &gt;&gt; That's pretty cool. &gt;&gt; That's pretty cool. &gt;&gt; That's pretty cool. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, each of you sharks, you have a &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, each of you sharks, you have a &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, each of you sharks, you have a sample in front of you of our chomp saw. sample in front of you of our chomp saw. sample in front of you of our chomp saw. And we'd love for each of you to try And we'd love for each of you to try And we'd love for each of you to try cutting out. cutting out. cutting out. &gt;&gt; So, when a kid inevitably touches it, &gt;&gt; So, when a kid inevitably touches it, &gt;&gt; So, when a kid inevitably touches it, what happens? what happens? what happens? &gt;&gt; Let me show you. If I try shoving my &gt;&gt; Let me show you. If I try shoving my &gt;&gt; Let me show you. If I try shoving my finger, even if you take the cardboard finger, even if you take the cardboard finger, even if you take the cardboard out, out, out, &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah.
