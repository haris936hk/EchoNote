is our first foray into pitcher which is our first foray into pitcher which is our first foray into the home let me do that real quick and the home let me do that real quick and the home let me do that real quick and while that's going I'll show you a video while that's going I'll show you a video while that's going I'll show you a video of how that works traditional water of how that works traditional water of how that works traditional water pitchers use a filter and the biggest pitchers use a filter and the biggest pitchers use a filter and the biggest problem is that they only trap problem is that they only trap problem is that they only trap contaminants where they could quickly contaminants where they could quickly contaminants where they could quickly accumulate and multiply and actually accumulate and multiply and actually accumulate and multiply and actually reverse contaminate your water why do reverse contaminate your water why do reverse contaminate your water why do they reverse contaminate because the they reverse contaminate because the they reverse contaminate because the contaminants are being trapped and contaminants are being trapped and contaminants are being trapped and collected there and as germs are growing collected there and as germs are growing collected there and as germs are growing there it's a wet porous environment there it's a wet porous environment there it's a wet porous environment that's dark so imagine all the things that's dark so imagine all the things that's dark so imagine all the things that could be growing there so we take a that could be growing there so we take a that could be growing there so we take a two-step approach the first step you see two-step approach the first step you see two-step approach the first step you see it go through and it captures things it go through and it captures things it go through and it captures things like lead cadmium mercury in the Second like lead cadmium mercury in the Second like lead cadmium mercury in the Second Step you simply press this button and Step you simply press this button and Step you simply press this button and it'll purify the water that's gone it'll purify the water that's gone it'll purify the water that's gone through and as you can see that is a through and as you can see that is a through and as you can see that is a clear water that we pour blue water in clear water that we pour blue water in clear water that we pour blue water in that's contaminated clear water but is that's contaminated clear water but is that's contaminated clear
