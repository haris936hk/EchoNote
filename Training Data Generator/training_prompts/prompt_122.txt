So, is this not even in production yet? production yet? production yet? &gt;&gt; It's not in production yet. &gt;&gt; It's not in production yet. &gt;&gt; It's not in production yet. &gt;&gt; What's the material that holds the &gt;&gt; What's the material that holds the &gt;&gt; What's the material that holds the temperature delta? temperature delta? temperature delta? &gt;&gt; Behind the stainless steel is our trade &gt;&gt; Behind the stainless steel is our trade &gt;&gt; Behind the stainless steel is our trade secret pronto gel. secret pronto gel. secret pronto gel. &gt;&gt; Is that patented? &gt;&gt; Is that patented? &gt;&gt; Is that patented? &gt;&gt; We have a provisional patent on it. Yes. &gt;&gt; We have a provisional patent on it. Yes. &gt;&gt; We have a provisional patent on it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; How did you come up with this idea? I &gt;&gt; How did you come up with this idea? I &gt;&gt; How did you come up with this idea? I was back in college trying to drink a was back in college trying to drink a was back in college trying to drink a bottle of wine with a girl and the wine bottle of wine with a girl and the wine bottle of wine with a girl and the wine was warm. So me being kind of like the was warm. So me being kind of like the was warm. So me being kind of like the inventor type, I grabbed a pasta inventor type, I grabbed a pasta inventor type, I grabbed a pasta strainer. I filled it with ice, poured strainer. I filled it with ice, poured strainer. I filled it with ice, poured the wine through and amazingly the wine the wine through and amazingly the wine the wine through and amazingly the wine was super cold super fast and we go to was super cold super fast and we go to was super cold super fast and we go to drink the wine and it was just horribly drink the wine and it was just horribly drink the wine and it was just horribly disgusting. disgusting. disgusting. &gt;&gt; When you did that, you also diluted the &gt;&gt; When you did that, you also diluted the &gt;&gt; When you did that, you also diluted the white ruin. white ruin. white ruin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that that is a huge issue in chilling &gt;&gt; So that that is a huge issue in chilling &gt;&gt; So that that is a huge issue in chilling white wines. This doesn't dilute it, white wines. This doesn't dilute it, white wines. This doesn't dilute it, which is a good thing. And I know that which is a good thing. And I know that which is a good thing. And I know that because I'm a member of the Chevier test because I'm a member of the Chevier test because I'm a member of the Chevier test and we care about the temperature of our and we care about the temperature of our and we care about the temperature of our wines. wines. wines. &gt;&gt; Drink &gt;&gt; Drink &gt;&gt; Drink to the Chev. [Music] [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, can you tell us where you're &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, can you tell us where you're &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, can you tell us where you're at with sales? at with sales? at with sales? &gt;&gt; Yes. So, we just finished our Indiegogo &gt;&gt; Yes. So, we just finished our Indiegogo &gt;&gt; Yes. So, we just finished our Indiegogo uh crowdfunding campaign yesterday and uh crowdfunding campaign yesterday and uh crowdfunding campaign yesterday and we raised $54,000. we raised $54,000. we raised $54,000. &gt;&gt; What were you looking for? 25,000. &gt;&gt; What were you looking for? 25,000. &gt;&gt; What were you looking for? 25,000. &gt;&gt; And what does it cost &gt;&gt; And what does it cost &gt;&gt; And what does it cost &gt;&gt; on crowdfunding? It's $89. When we're &gt;&gt; on crowdfunding? It's $89. When we're &gt;&gt; on crowdfunding? It's $89. When we're actually selling it, we'll sell it for actually selling it, we'll sell it for actually selling it, we'll sell it for $129. $129. $129. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Cost us $22 to make. &gt;&gt; Cost us $22 to make. &gt;&gt; Cost us $22 to make. &gt;&gt; So, if you're positioning this product &gt;&gt; So, if you're positioning this product &gt;&gt; So, if you're positioning this product as a wine chiller, basically, why do you as a wine chiller, basically, why do you as a wine chiller, basically, why do you have to put it back in the bottle? have to put it back in the bottle? have to put it back in the bottle? &gt;&gt; The way we can get it to chill so &gt;&gt; The way we can get it to chill so &gt;&gt; The way we can get it to chill so quickly, it basically is like a cannon quickly, it basically is like a cannon quickly, it basically is like a cannon blast of cold. blast of cold. blast of cold. &gt;&gt; You're saying it freezes if you leave it &gt;&gt; You're saying it freezes if you leave it &gt;&gt; You're saying it freezes if you leave it inside it? inside it? inside it? &gt;&gt; It won't freeze, but the temperature &gt;&gt; It won't freeze, but the temperature &gt;&gt; It won't freeze, but the temperature will keep dropping. With any alcoholic will keep dropping. With any alcoholic will keep dropping. With any alcoholic drink, there's a perfect temperature. drink, there's a perfect temperature. drink, there's a perfect temperature. And just to let you know, all of the And just to let you know, all of the And just to let you know, all of the temperatures are written right on the temperatures are written right on the temperatures are written right on the packaging. packaging. packaging. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So, you seem to &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So, you seem to &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. So, you seem to know a lot about wine. What's your know a lot about wine. What's your know a lot about wine. What's your background? background? background? &gt;&gt; I actually studied entrepreneurship. &gt;&gt; I actually studied entrepreneurship. &gt;&gt; I actually studied entrepreneurship. &gt;&gt; Where at? &gt;&gt; Where at? &gt;&gt; Where at? &gt;&gt; At Arizona State. I came up with this &gt;&gt; At Arizona State. I came up with this &gt;&gt; At Arizona State. I came up with this idea. Like I said, I've worked for other idea. Like I said, I've worked for other idea. Like I said, I've worked for other startups in the past, but I've known my startups in the past, but I've known my startups in the past, but I've known my entire life that I was going to do entire life that I was going to do entire life that I was going to do something like this. So, I have no idea something like this. So, I have no idea something like this. So, I have no idea why people aren't really going over this why people aren't really going over this why people aren't really going over this valuation. So, let's look at the valuation. So, let's look at the valuation. So, let's look at the crowdfunding platform you're on. You crowdfunding platform you're on. You crowdfunding platform you're on. You only sold $54,000 worth only sold $54,000 worth only sold $54,000 worth &gt;&gt; in two months. The first two months. &gt;&gt; in two months. The first two months. &gt;&gt; in two months. The first two months. &gt;&gt; Do you have some other stuff that's &gt;&gt; Do you have some other stuff that's &gt;&gt; Do you have some other stuff that's going to give us uh a reason to get to a going to give us uh a reason to get to a going to give us uh a reason to get to a $2 million valuation? $2 million valuation? $2 million valuation? &gt;&gt; There is another reason. So, one of our &gt;&gt; There is another reason. So, one of our &gt;&gt; There is another reason. So, one of our biggest competitors, they're also a wine biggest competitors, they're also a wine biggest competitors, they're also a wine chiller, but they take way longer and chiller, but they take way longer and chiller, but they take way longer and there are other drawbacks to the product there are other drawbacks to the product there are other drawbacks to the product that Prontov has a lot of advantages that Prontov has a lot of advantages that Prontov has a lot of advantages over. over. over. &gt;&gt; What does the competition cost? &gt;&gt; What does the competition cost? &gt;&gt; What does the competition cost? &gt;&gt; What does it cost? They charge uh $80. &gt;&gt; What does it cost? They charge uh $80. &gt;&gt; What does it cost? They charge uh $80. &gt;&gt; They're doing how much in business? &gt;&gt; They're doing how much in business? &gt;&gt; They're doing how much in business? &gt;&gt; 10 to 20 million a year. &gt;&gt; 10 to 20 million a year. &gt;&gt; 10 to 20 million a year. &gt;&gt; 10 to 20. That's a big big swing. But um &gt;&gt; 10 to 20. That's a big big swing. But um &gt;&gt; 10 to 20. That's a big big swing. But um so you believe that that's why you're so you believe that that's why you're so you believe that that's why you're worth $2 million. worth $2 million. worth $2 million. &gt;&gt; I see our products as being worth far &gt;&gt; I see our products as being worth far &gt;&gt; I see our products as being worth far more than that. more than that. more than that. &gt;&gt; You've been watching Shark Tank. Where &gt;&gt; You've been watching Shark Tank. Where &gt;&gt; You've been watching Shark Tank. Where did we go wrong? Why do you think we did we go wrong? Why do you think we did we go wrong? Why do you think we would ever invest in a company at this would ever invest in a company at this would ever invest in a company at this level with a $2 million evaluation? level with a $2 million evaluation? level with a $2 million evaluation? &gt;&gt; This company has only one direction to &gt;&gt; This company has only one direction to &gt;&gt; This company has only one direction to go and that's up. Well, then I failed go and that's up. Well, then I failed go and that's up. Well, then I failed you because I obviously am not giving you because I obviously am not giving you because I obviously am not giving the right lessons here and the right the right lessons here and the right the right lessons here and the right information because I don't want you to information because I don't want you to information because I don't want you to go into another room and make a stupid go into another room and make a stupid go into another room and make a stupid mistake like that. Valuation is crazy. mistake like that. Valuation is crazy. mistake like that. Valuation is crazy. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. &gt;&gt; Okay. One of the challenges I have in &gt;&gt; Okay. One of the challenges I have in &gt;&gt; Okay. One of the challenges I have in working with inventors, when you're an working with inventors, when you're an working with inventors, when you're an inventor first and an entrepreneur inventor first and an entrepreneur inventor first and an entrepreneur second, you want to invent, second, you want to invent, second, you want to invent, &gt;&gt; but the harder part is turning into a &gt;&gt; but the harder part is turning into a &gt;&gt; but the harder part is turning into a company that's profitable enough to make company that's profitable enough to make company that's profitable enough to make it worthwhile. Valuing this company at it worthwhile. Valuing this company at it worthwhile. Valuing this company at $2 million. I just don't see that. I $2 million. I just don't see that. I $2 million. I just don't see that. I don't see it going there. And so for don't see it going there. And so for don't see it going there. And so for those reasons, I'm out. those reasons, I'm out. those reasons, I'm out. &gt;&gt; Oh, that hurts. Mark, we've been a great &gt;&gt; Oh, that hurts.
