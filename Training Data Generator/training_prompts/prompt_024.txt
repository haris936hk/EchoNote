TASK
Create a comprehensive summary in JSON format using BOTH the transcript and NLP features:

{
  "executiveSummary": "2-3 sentences capturing main purpose and outcomes",
  "keyDecisions": "Important decisions made, or 'No major decisions recorded'",
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "What needs to be done",
      "assignee": "Person responsible or null",
      "deadline": "When due or null",
      "priority": "high/medium/low"
    }
  ],
  "nextSteps": "What happens next after this meeting",
  "keyTopics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "sentiment": "positive/neutral/negative/mixed"
}

GUIDELINES
- Use identified entities to ensure accuracy
- Match action items with extracted action patterns
- Align topics with pre-identified themes
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Extract ONLY information from the transcript
- If assignee/deadline not mentioned, use null
- If no action items, return empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
