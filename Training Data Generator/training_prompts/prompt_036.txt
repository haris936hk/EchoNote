The top doubles as a pour serve store station, doubles as a pour serve store station, doubles as a pour serve store station, aka it's also a bar cart. And with our aka it's also a bar cart. And with our aka it's also a bar cart. And with our patent pending site system, you can even patent pending site system, you can even patent pending site system, you can even see inside your fridge right from your see inside your fridge right from your see inside your fridge right from your phone. Imagine you're at the grocery phone. Imagine you're at the grocery phone. Imagine you're at the grocery store. You're having friends over later store. You're having friends over later store. You're having friends over later and you can't remember if you have and you can't remember if you have and you can't remember if you have enough beer. Now, all you have to do is enough beer. Now, all you have to do is enough beer. Now, all you have to do is look at the app and you'll know exactly look at the app and you'll know exactly look at the app and you'll know exactly how much you need. So, Sharks, who's how much you need. So, Sharks, who's how much you need. So, Sharks, who's ready to do a deal and pop some ready to do a deal and pop some ready to do a deal and pop some champagne? champagne? champagne? All right. I know what's coming. All All right.

[Applause] And in front of you are the um trays And in front of you are the um trays And in front of you are the um trays that come with the fridge to kind of that come with the fridge to kind of that come with the fridge to kind of turn it into a bar cart. How much is the turn it into a bar cart. How much is the turn it into a bar cart. How much is the fridge? The fridge is $14.95 and we fridge? The fridge is $14.95 and we fridge? The fridge is $14.95 and we currently offer early access pricing of currently offer early access pricing of currently offer early access pricing of $12.95. Is that a lot for a basic? As a $12.95.

You sell it for fridges and suitcases. You sell it for fridges and suitcases. You sell it for $12.95 or $14.95. What does it cost you $12.95 or $14.95. What does it cost you $12.95 or $14.95. What does it cost you to make? So, our landed costs are to make? So, our landed costs are to make? So, our landed costs are $575 and then after shipping, which is $575 and then after shipping, which is $575 and then after shipping, which is another $130 to $160 depending on where another $130 to $160 depending on where another $130 to $160 depending on where you are in the country, it gets to you are in the country, it gets to you are in the country, it gets to around 750 to 775.
