It's like breathing. But what granted. It's like breathing. But what granted. It's like breathing. But what if we told you there was a revolutionary if we told you there was a revolutionary if we told you there was a revolutionary material that could alter performance material that could alter performance material that could alter performance outcomes in virtually any sport? outcomes in virtually any sport? outcomes in virtually any sport? Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement Introducing Chocolas, a grip enhancement technology used to absorb oil on the technology used to absorb oil on the technology used to absorb oil on the skin and it's used for athletes, the skin and it's used for athletes, the skin and it's used for athletes, the military, and everyday uses that once military, and everyday uses that once military, and everyday uses that once applied absorbs oil in the skin that applied absorbs oil in the skin that applied absorbs oil in the skin that creates the slip in grip. Our grip creates the slip in grip. Our grip creates the slip in grip. Our grip solution is made from a unique but well- solution is made from a unique but well- solution is made from a unique but well- tested material that's non-toxic, tested material that's non-toxic, tested material that's non-toxic, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, environmentally friendly, it's low mess, works even after being underwater, and works even after being underwater, and works even after being underwater, and is the first significant innovation in is the first significant innovation in is the first significant innovation in grip technology in nearly 70 years. We grip technology in nearly 70 years. We grip technology in nearly 70 years. We want a shark to come up and try it with want a shark to come up and try it with want a shark to come up and try it with us. Rashan. Oh, us. Rashan. Oh, us. Rashan. Oh, &gt;&gt; how about you come up and try &gt;&gt; how about you come up and try &gt;&gt; how about you come up and try chocolates? chocolates? chocolates? &gt;&gt; Go get them, Rashan. &gt;&gt; Go get them, Rashan. &gt;&gt; Go get them, Rashan. &gt;&gt; Here, let's give you a try on the torque &gt;&gt; Here, let's give you a try on the torque &gt;&gt; Here, let's give you a try on the torque test. We'll see how you do. So, here, test. We'll see how you do. So, here, test. We'll see how you do. So, here, step right over here, please. step right over here, please. step right over here, please. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. What I'm going to ask you to do when I What I'm going to ask you to do when I What I'm going to ask you to do when I say start is you're going to grab that say start is you're going to grab that say start is you're going to grab that metal bar and you're going to rotate it metal bar and you're going to rotate it metal bar and you're going to rotate it backwards as hard as you can. Okay? backwards as hard as you can. Okay? backwards as hard as you can. Okay? &gt;&gt; So, our patent pending piece of &gt;&gt; So, our patent pending piece of &gt;&gt; So, our patent pending piece of equipment actually measures the amount equipment actually measures the amount equipment actually measures the amount of torque you're able to generate before of torque you're able to generate before of torque you're able to generate before your grip starts to slip. your grip starts to slip. your grip starts to slip. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; So, let me push the start button. &gt;&gt; So, let me push the start button. &gt;&gt; So, let me push the start button. &gt;&gt; All right. Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Right. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Give it a twist backwards. Oh, excellent. All right. Oh, excellent. All right. Oh, excellent. All right. So, that right there you maxed out about So, that right there you maxed out about So, that right there you maxed out about 14 pounds. You ever seen anything like 14 pounds. You ever seen anything like 14 pounds. You ever seen anything like that? that? that? &gt;&gt; Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. So, &gt;&gt; Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. So, &gt;&gt; Best one I've ever seen. Absolutely. So, what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to put a single dose of chocolates on your put a single dose of chocolates on your put a single dose of chocolates on your hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. So, hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. So, hand. It's about a half a teaspoon. So, we just spring salt. You can barely see we just spring salt. You can barely see we just spring salt. You can barely see it. it. it. &gt;&gt; You can barely see it. You just sprink &gt;&gt; You can barely see it. You just sprink &gt;&gt; You can barely see it. You just sprink it on. Now, put the other hand on top. it on. Now, put the other hand on top. it on. Now, put the other hand on top. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And grind them together. What you're &gt;&gt; And grind them together. What you're &gt;&gt; And grind them together. What you're doing, you're you're stripping away all doing, you're you're stripping away all doing, you're you're stripping away all the oil in your skin that makes it the oil in your skin that makes it the oil in your skin that makes it slippery between the cracks up. Yep. slippery between the cracks up. Yep. slippery between the cracks up. Yep. Once you're done, you clap away any Once you're done, you clap away any Once you're done, you clap away any residual material. And we're gonna do it residual material. And we're gonna do it residual material. And we're gonna do it again. again. again. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's so light. Like, you can &gt;&gt; I mean, it's so light. Like, you can &gt;&gt; I mean, it's so light. Like, you can barely feel anything. Let's see what barely feel anything. Let's see what barely feel anything. Let's see what happens. happens. happens. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you tipped over the machine. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you tipped over the machine. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you tipped over the machine. &gt;&gt; Nice job. All right, so we'll see here. &gt;&gt; Nice job. All right, so we'll see here. &gt;&gt; Nice job. All right, so we'll see here. So, that right there, even with the So, that right there, even with the So, that right there, even with the machine tipping, which was your peak, so machine tipping, which was your peak, so machine tipping, which was your peak, so you actually lost some of it there, you you actually lost some of it there, you you actually lost some of it there, you were still a 60% improvement in the were still a 60% improvement in the were still a 60% improvement in the overall torque you're able to generate overall torque you're able to generate overall torque you're able to generate once you got rid of that slippery once you got rid of that slippery once you got rid of that slippery component to your grip. component to your grip. component to your grip. &gt;&gt; Honestly, it didn't move at all. Like, &gt;&gt; Honestly, it didn't move at all. Like, &gt;&gt; Honestly, it didn't move at all. Like, it's it's it's &gt;&gt; it almost feels like like chalk, but &gt;&gt; it almost feels like like chalk, but &gt;&gt; it almost feels like like chalk, but more permanent almost. It's actually more permanent almost. It's actually more permanent almost. It's actually nothing like chalk to be technically nothing like chalk to be technically nothing like chalk to be technically correct. correct. correct. &gt;&gt; That's why they call it &gt;&gt; That's why they call it &gt;&gt; That's why they call it &gt;&gt; chalk compared to chalk. &gt;&gt; chalk compared to chalk. &gt;&gt; chalk compared to chalk. &gt;&gt; What's like the main difference? &gt;&gt; What's like the main difference? &gt;&gt; What's like the main difference? &gt;&gt; So the main difference here is we're a &gt;&gt; So the main difference here is we're a &gt;&gt; So the main difference here is we're a subtractive material. So we're actually subtractive material. So we're actually subtractive material. So we're actually trying to remove something. It's the oil trying to remove something. It's the oil trying to remove something. It's the oil on your skin that causes the problem. on your skin that causes the problem. on your skin that causes the problem. &gt;&gt; Let's talk sales. &gt;&gt; Let's talk sales. &gt;&gt; Let's talk sales. &gt;&gt; So sales um sales for this year thus far &gt;&gt; So sales um sales for this year thus far &gt;&gt; So sales um sales for this year thus far have been 740,000. have been 740,000. have been 740,000. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So here's the thing. Grip, no one really &gt;&gt; So here's the thing. Grip, no one really &gt;&gt; So here's the thing. Grip, no one really thought about it, right? So if no one's thought about it, right? So if no one's thought about it, right? So if no one's thinking about their grip, there's a thinking about their grip, there's a thinking about their grip, there's a huge marketplace for us in the grip. huge marketplace for us in the grip. huge marketplace for us in the grip. &gt;&gt; That's not true. Athletes deal with it. &gt;&gt; That's not true. Athletes deal with it. &gt;&gt; That's not true. Athletes deal with it. Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss Gymnasts deal with it. Weightlifterss deal with it. So that's not nobody. deal with it. So that's not nobody. deal with it. So that's not nobody. &gt;&gt; No. What I mean by nobody is the masses. &gt;&gt; No. What I mean by nobody is the masses. &gt;&gt; No. What I mean by nobody is the masses. &gt;&gt; I mean, LeBron James, you know, &gt;&gt; I mean, LeBron James, you know, &gt;&gt; I mean, LeBron James, you know, &gt;&gt; LeBron James would benefit from our &gt;&gt; LeBron James would benefit from our &gt;&gt; LeBron James would benefit from our products so much you cannot imagine. products so much you cannot imagine. products so much you cannot imagine. &gt;&gt; Then we don't want him to have it. &gt;&gt; Then we don't want him to have it. &gt;&gt; Then we don't want him to have it. &gt;&gt; Is this illegal in the NBA? &gt;&gt; Is this illegal in the NBA? &gt;&gt; Is this illegal in the NBA? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, &gt;&gt; Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, &gt;&gt; Our biggest market, golf, racket sports, and fitness.

That's why I wanted which I really like. That's why I wanted which I really like. That's why I wanted as my partner. as my partner. as my partner. &gt;&gt; Well, you think they'll actually talk &gt;&gt; Well, you think they'll actually talk &gt;&gt; Well, you think they'll actually talk about it. Will they be willing to state about it. Will they be willing to state about it. Will they be willing to state that they're using the product? that they're using the product? that they're using the product? &gt;&gt; I think if we opened another round in &gt;&gt; I think if we opened another round in &gt;&gt; I think if we opened another round in the future and we gave them the the future and we gave them the the future and we gave them the opportunity to have to invest and be opportunity to have to invest and be opportunity to have to invest and be equity investors as opposed to brand equity investors as opposed to brand equity investors as opposed to brand ambassadors. Yes, ambassadors. Yes, ambassadors. Yes, &gt;&gt; you can't afford to have them as as &gt;&gt; you can't afford to have them as as &gt;&gt; you can't afford to have them as as marketing guys because they're too marketing guys because they're too marketing guys because they're too expensive.

TASK
Create a comprehensive summary in JSON format using BOTH the transcript and NLP features:

{
  "executiveSummary": "2-3 sentences capturing main purpose and outcomes",
  "keyDecisions": "Important decisions made, or 'No major decisions recorded'",
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "What needs to be done",
      "assignee": "Person responsible or null",
      "deadline": "When due or null",
      "priority": "high/medium/low"
    }
  ],
  "nextSteps": "What happens next after this meeting",
  "keyTopics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "sentiment": "positive/neutral/negative/mixed"
}

- Use identified entities to ensure accuracy
- Match action items with extracted action patterns
- Align topics with pre-identified themes
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Extract ONLY information from the transcript
- If assignee/deadline not mentioned, use null
- If no action items, return empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
