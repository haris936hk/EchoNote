So, every single year, Americans spend $70 billion on lawn care Americans spend $70 billion on lawn care Americans spend $70 billion on lawn care services that are stuck in the dark services that are stuck in the dark services that are stuck in the dark ages. Landscapers are notoriously ages. Landscapers are notoriously ages. Landscapers are notoriously unreliable and they use dirty gas unreliable and they use dirty gas unreliable and they use dirty gas powered mowers that are destroying the powered mowers that are destroying the powered mowers that are destroying the planet in the 21st century when I can planet in the 21st century when I can planet in the 21st century when I can get a batterypowered car that can drive get a batterypowered car that can drive get a batterypowered car that can drive itself. Why in the world is my lawn itself. Why in the world is my lawn itself.

TASK
Create a comprehensive summary in JSON format using BOTH the transcript and NLP features:

{
  "executiveSummary": "2-3 sentences capturing main purpose and outcomes",
  "keyDecisions": "Important decisions made, or 'No major decisions recorded'",
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "What needs to be done",
      "assignee": "Person responsible or null",
      "deadline": "When due or null",
      "priority": "high/medium/low"
    }
  ],
  "nextSteps": "What happens next after this meeting",
  "keyTopics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "sentiment": "positive/neutral/negative/mixed"
}

GUIDELINES
- Use identified entities to ensure accuracy
- Match action items with extracted action patterns
- Align topics with pre-identified themes
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Extract ONLY information from the transcript
- If assignee/deadline not mentioned, use null
- If no action items, return empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
