and that 3D printers have been unique and that 3D printers have been unique and that 3D printers have been out now for a while what's different is out now for a while what's different is out now for a while what's different is is that yours is specifically for toys is that yours is specifically for toys is that yours is specifically for toys and is it therefore smaller and less and is it therefore smaller and less and is it therefore smaller and less expensive than others out there yeah so expensive than others out there yeah so expensive than others out there yeah so we sell this printer for $99 which is we sell this printer for $99 which is we sell this printer for $99 which is definitely on the cheapest end of 3D definitely on the cheapest end of 3D definitely on the cheapest end of 3D printers uh what we do specially for printers uh what we do specially for printers uh what we do specially for kids is we combine hardware and software kids is we combine hardware and software kids is we combine hardware and software to make a really friendly user to make a really friendly user to make a really friendly user experience so we have right now over 750 experience so we have right now over 750 experience so we have right now over 750 toys we add 7 to 10 toys a week and then toys we add 7 to 10 toys a week and then toys we add 7 to 10 toys a week and then uh we're always monitoring what kids are uh we're always monitoring what kids are uh we're always monitoring what kids are playing with and we adjust what we add playing with and we adjust what we add playing with and we adjust what we add based off of that you the worry with based off of that you the worry with based off of that you the worry with toys is that it gets you know used a toys is that it gets you know used a toys is that it gets you know used a couple times and then put away and at couple times and then put away and at couple times and then put away and at 299 that's that's a big decision on a 299 that's that's a big decision on a 299 that's that's a big decision on a toy what are your sales like so right toy what are your sales like so right toy what are your sales like so right now we're focusing
