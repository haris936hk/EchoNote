So, rusting as soon as it gets wet. So, rusting as soon as it gets wet. So, inside the chamber, we have special inside the chamber, we have special inside the chamber, we have special metallic beads. What these do is metallic beads. What these do is metallic beads. What these do is surround any device inside with a warm, surround any device inside with a warm, surround any device inside with a warm, gentle heat. The gentle heat. The gentle heat. The device goes inside. Then, what the device goes inside. Then, what the device goes inside. Then, what the machine will do is remove all of the air machine will do is remove all of the air machine will do is remove all of the air from the chamber. And the combination of from the chamber. And the combination of from the chamber. And the combination of that plus the gentle heat turns all the that plus the gentle heat turns all the that plus the gentle heat turns all the liquid into gas and makes it leave the liquid into gas and makes it leave the liquid into gas and makes it leave the phone instantly. Interesting. By the phone instantly. Interesting. By the phone instantly. Interesting. By the time that you get into the machine, time that you get into the machine, time that you get into the machine, maybe the phone's gone. So, I feel it's maybe the phone's gone.

You want to come as quick fast, right? You want to come as quick fast, right? You want to come as quick as possible. And certainly best results as possible. And certainly best results as possible. And certainly best results are the same day it got wet, but we've are the same day it got wet, but we've are the same day it got wet, but we've saved devices several days later. saved devices several days later. saved devices several days later. Really? So, technically someone could Really? So, technically someone could Really? So, technically someone could ship it to you. Like, are you online or ship it to you. Like, are you online or ship it to you. Like, are you online or are you a store? We're currently in 82 are you a store? We're currently in 82 are you a store? We're currently in 82 big box retail stores as well as we have big box retail stores as well as we have big box retail stores as well as we have a mail-in service. But what are your a mail-in service. But what are your a mail-in service. But what are your sales? So last year with just a few sales? So last year with just a few sales? So last year with just a few stores we did stores we did stores we did $29,000 82 stores, right? We're talking $29,000 82 stores, right? We're talking $29,000 82 stores, right?

They'll charge the customer $69 for a $69 is expensive. How much does it for a $69 is expensive. How much does it for a $69 is expensive. How much does it cost to make one? So, in the in the cost to make one? So, in the in the cost to make one? So, in the in the beginning at low production rates, it beginning at low production rates, it beginning at low production rates, it was over $8,000 to make one of these was over $8,000 to make one of these was over $8,000 to make one of these machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less machines. Eight. Now, it's now it's less than three. What do you charge them for than three. What do you charge them for than three. What do you charge them for the rent on that box? So, on average, it the rent on that box? So, on average, it the rent on that box?
