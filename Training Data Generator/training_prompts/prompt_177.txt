micro ability Market which is and the micro ability Market which is and the micro ability Market which is our goto market and then there's a piece our goto market and then there's a piece our goto market and then there's a piece missing here which is the rubber missing here which is the rubber missing here which is the rubber integration mhm and so we are patent integration mhm and so we are patent integration mhm and so we are patent pending on the integration of night pending on the integration of night pending on the integration of night andol with rubber to produce any tire on andol with rubber to produce any tire on andol with rubber to produce any tire on Earth you're going to need that rubber Earth you're going to need that rubber Earth you're going to need that rubber those that we're seeing there is in the those that we're seeing there is in the those that we're seeing there is in the raw form but they're going to have to be raw form but they're going to have to be raw
