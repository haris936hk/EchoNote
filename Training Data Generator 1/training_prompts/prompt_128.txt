Kind: captions Language: en Next into the tank is a business that Next into the tank is a business that Next into the tank is a business that aspires to make unmanned flight aspires to make unmanned flight aspires to make unmanned flight accessible for everyone. Hi, I'm JD Clarage. Hi, I'm JD Clarage. Hi, I'm JD Clarage. And I'm Charles Manning. Our company is And I'm Charles Manning. Our company is And I'm Charles Manning. Our company is XCraft. We're looking to seek $500,000 XCraft. We're looking to seek $500,000 XCraft. We're looking to seek $500,000 in exchange for 20% of the company. in exchange for 20% of the company. in exchange for 20% of the company. Much like when the Wright brothers first Much like when the Wright brothers first Much like when the Wright brothers first took flight in 1903, we're witnessing a took flight in 1903, we're witnessing a took flight in 1903, we're witnessing a new dawn of aviation, the age of new dawn of aviation, the age of new dawn of aviation, the age of unmanned flight. The X+1 is a drone unmanned flight. The X+1 is a drone unmanned flight. The X+1 is a drone redefined. We've combined both the redefined. We've combined both the redefined. We've combined both the hovering precision of a helicopter and hovering precision of a helicopter and hovering precision of a helicopter and the fast flight of an aircraft. You can the fast flight of an aircraft. You can the fast flight of an aircraft. You can soar at speeds of up to 60 mph and climb soar at speeds of up to 60 mph and climb soar at speeds of up to 60 mph and climb as high as 10,000 ft. Wa! And you can as high as 10,000 ft. Wa! And you can as high as 10,000 ft. Wa! And you can seamlessly transition from high speed seamlessly transition from high speed seamlessly transition from high speed back to hover. back to hover. back to hover. How cool. How cool. How cool. XCraft is breaking boundaries and with XCraft is breaking boundaries and with XCraft is breaking boundaries and with your help, the sky will no longer be the your help, the sky will no longer be the your help, the sky will no longer be the limit. limit. limit. JD, how is it different from all the JD, how is it different from all the JD, how is it different from all the traditional drones I can buy today? traditional drones I can buy today? traditional drones I can buy today? So, the fundamental difference is the So, the fundamental difference is the So, the fundamental difference is the ability to transition to forward flight. ability to transition to forward flight. ability to transition to forward flight. And it does that with a wing. And it does that with a wing. And it does that with a wing. This is the wing right here. This this This is the wing right here. This this This is the wing right here. This this this main area is the wing. this main area is the wing. this main area is the wing. Okay. So, so, uh, it's hovering and then Okay. So, so, uh, it's hovering and then Okay. So, so, uh, it's hovering and then when you want to go into forward flight, when you want to go into forward flight, when you want to go into forward flight, it rotates like that. it rotates like that. it rotates like that. Now, it's an airplane. Now, it's an airplane. Now, it's an airplane. Why do I care the fact that I can go so Why do I care the fact that I can go so Why do I care the fact that I can go so much faster? much faster? much faster? You can capture a fastoving subject like You can capture a fastoving subject like You can capture a fastoving subject like a car or, you know, a motorcycle or a car or, you know, a motorcycle or a car or, you know, a motorcycle or something like that. something like that. something like that. What's the range on this? Because if What's the range on this? Because if What's the range on this? Because if it's going 60 m an hour, uh, you would it's going 60 m an hour, uh, you would it's going 60 m an hour, uh, you would have to probably be in a helicopter to have to probably be in a helicopter to have to probably be in a helicopter to accompany it, right? Or or you can be accompany it, right? Or or you can be accompany it, right? Or or you can be stationary. stationary. stationary. You can be stationary. Yeah. I mean, it You can be stationary. Yeah. I mean, it You can be stationary. Yeah. I mean, it definitely it's maneuverable, so you can definitely it's maneuverable, so you can definitely it's maneuverable, so you can stay within visual range. But one key stay within visual range. But one key stay within visual range. But one key part is that this system actually can part is that this system actually can part is that this system actually can run entirely autonomously. You can build run entirely autonomously. You can build run entirely autonomously. You can build a flight plan on a c on a on a software a flight plan on a c on a on a software a flight plan on a c on a on a software system on a PC and have it go do those system on a PC and have it go do those system on a PC and have it go do those things and come back. things and come back. things and come back. Charles, am I allowed to create a flight Charles, am I allowed to create a flight Charles, am I allowed to create a flight plan for an unmanned drone and just lay plan for an unmanned drone and just lay plan for an unmanned drone and just lay it out there? it out there? it out there? Yes, that's a good question, Robert. Yes, that's a good question, Robert. Yes, that's a good question, Robert. There there are regulations and and There there are regulations and and There there are regulations and and rules right now and and primarily uh if rules right now and and primarily uh if rules right now and and primarily uh if you're flying for recreational purposes, you're flying for recreational purposes, you're flying for recreational purposes, uh you need to keep it within line of uh you need to keep it within line of uh you need to keep it within line of sight. Stay away from other aircraft and sight. Stay away from other aircraft and sight. Stay away from other aircraft and airports, right? airports, right? airports, right? Uh as well as personal property. And Uh as well as personal property. And Uh as well as personal property. And then you can't fly any higher than 400 then you can't fly any higher than 400 then you can't fly any higher than 400 feet. feet. feet. How much does it cost you to make? How much does it cost you to make? How much does it cost you to make? Uh it cost us $400 to make it. Uh it cost us $400 to make it. Uh it cost us $400 to make it. And what do you sell it for? And what do you sell it for? And what do you sell it for? It retails right now for $1,800. It retails right now for $1,800. It retails right now for $1,800. Have you sold any? Have you sold any?

Are you uh engineers or? Yeah. So, uh I have worked um an Yeah. So, uh I have worked um an Yeah. So, uh I have worked um an aerospace engineer by trade. aerospace engineer by trade. aerospace engineer by trade. I started out of school and worked at I started out of school and worked at I started out of school and worked at Oracle and I've been in software my Oracle and I've been in software my Oracle and I've been in software my whole history. Um whole history. Um whole history. Um I was looking at some drones yesterday I was looking at some drones yesterday I was looking at some drones yesterday actually because I have a property with actually because I have a property with actually because I have a property with 36 acres and I want to buy something cuz 36 acres and I want to buy something cuz 36 acres and I want to buy something cuz I'm getting a designation of managed I'm getting a designation of managed I'm getting a designation of managed forest and one of my responsibilities is forest and one of my responsibilities is forest and one of my responsibilities is to scan it every year to look for to scan it every year to look for to scan it every year to look for diseased trees. So, I'm going to buy a diseased trees. So, I'm going to buy a diseased trees. So, I'm going to buy a drone. Can I configure the camera on a drone. Can I configure the camera on a drone. Can I configure the camera on a gyroscope below it so that I can film gyroscope below it so that I can film gyroscope below it so that I can film from below? Cuz I have to turn it into from below? Cuz I have to turn it into from below? Cuz I have to turn it into airplane mode to use that camera the way airplane mode to use that camera the way airplane mode to use that camera the way you've got it configured. you've got it configured. you've got it configured. We're working on it right now so that we We're working on it right now so that we We're working on it right now so that we can actually hover it invert it and can actually hover it invert it and can actually hover it invert it and Oh, there's more. Oh, there's more. Oh, there's more. Yeah. So, uh this is called phone drone. Yeah. So, uh this is called phone drone. Yeah. So, uh this is called phone drone. A what? A what? A what? Phone drone. Phone drone. Phone drone. Phone drone. Phone drone. Phone drone. Bingo. Bingo. Bingo. So, uh we can use our smartphones for So, uh we can use our smartphones for So, uh we can use our smartphones for all different sorts of things today. all different sorts of things today. all different sorts of things today. That's great. But never have we been That's great. But never have we been That's great. But never have we been able to uh allow our smartphones to fly able to uh allow our smartphones to fly able to uh allow our smartphones to fly until now. I love this stuff. And uh we until now. I love this stuff. And uh we until now. I love this stuff. And uh we have a little video that uh we can show have a little video that uh we can show have a little video that uh we can show you. you. you. Sure. We love to see that. Sure. We love to see that. Sure. We love to see that. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, that is so cool. Oh, that is so cool. Oh, that is so cool. And do you use the sensors in the phone And do you use the sensors in the phone And do you use the sensors in the phone to do the balance and everything? to do the balance and everything? to do the balance and everything? Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. We do. So yeah, uh smartphones today We do. So yeah, uh smartphones today We do. So yeah, uh smartphones today have, you know, gyros and have, you know, gyros and have, you know, gyros and accelerometers. Uh they've got GPS. accelerometers. Uh they've got GPS. accelerometers. Uh they've got GPS. They've got a lot of them have very They've got a lot of them have very They've got a lot of them have very decent cameras. So really that's all the decent cameras. So really that's all the decent cameras. So really that's all the expensive components in a drone. So so expensive components in a drone. So so expensive components in a drone. So so we've leveraged that and basically we've leveraged that and basically we've leveraged that and basically turned a smartphone into a drone. turned a smartphone into a drone. turned a smartphone into a drone. How much does this one cost to make and How much does this one cost to make and How much does this one cost to make and how much do you sell it for? how much do you sell it for? how much do you sell it for? This is not currently for sale. This is This is not currently for sale. This is This is not currently for sale. This is in development. in development. in development. What do you think it will cost? What do you think it will cost? What do you think it will cost? Uh we're looking at around a price point Uh we're looking at around a price point Uh we're looking at around a price point retail of $300. Probably less than $100 retail of $300. Probably less than $100 retail of $300. Probably less than $100 to make. to make. to make. Jade, answer this for me. Where's the Jade, answer this for me. Where's the Jade, answer this for me. Where's the secret sauce in your company? Like tell secret sauce in your company? Like tell secret sauce in your company?

TASK
Create a comprehensive summary in JSON format using BOTH the transcript and NLP features:

{
  "executiveSummary": "2-3 sentences capturing main purpose and outcomes",
  "keyDecisions": "Important decisions made, or 'No major decisions recorded'",
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "What needs to be done",
      "assignee": "Person responsible or null",
      "deadline": "When due or null",
      "priority": "high/medium/low"
    }
  ],
  "nextSteps": "What happens next after this meeting",
  "keyTopics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "sentiment": "positive/neutral/negative/mixed"
}

GUIDELINES
- Use identified entities to ensure accuracy
- Match action items with extracted action patterns
- Align topics with pre-identified themes
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Extract ONLY information from the transcript
- If assignee/deadline not mentioned, use null
- If no action items, return empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
