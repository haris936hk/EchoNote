Hi Sharks, I'm Joel Pennington, form. Hi Sharks, I'm Joel Pennington, form. Hi Sharks, I'm Joel Pennington, the founder and CEO of Black Dot. the founder and CEO of Black Dot. the founder and CEO of Black Dot. Sharks, there's a multi-billion dollar Sharks, there's a multi-billion dollar Sharks, there's a multi-billion dollar industry that hasn't seen much by way of industry that hasn't seen much by way of industry that hasn't seen much by way of innovation in over 5,000 years. And the innovation in over 5,000 years. And the innovation in over 5,000 years. And the first client on record was Oatsie the first client on record was Oatsie the first client on record was Oatsie the Iceman. I'm talking about the tattoo Iceman. I'm talking about the tattoo Iceman. I'm talking about the tattoo industry. And while people are getting industry. And while people are getting industry. And while people are getting more tattoos and at a faster rate than more tattoos and at a faster rate than more tattoos and at a faster rate than ever before, there's a significant ever before, there's a significant ever before, there's a significant portion of the population that has been portion of the population that has been portion of the population that has been considering a tattoo, but is hesitant considering a tattoo, but is hesitant considering a tattoo, but is hesitant because of concerns around pain, design because of concerns around pain, design because of concerns around pain, design choices. Moreover, with social media, choices. Moreover, with social media, choices. Moreover, with social media, people are now able to see what top people are now able to see what top people are now able to see what top tattoo artists the world over are able tattoo artists the world over are able tattoo artists the world over are able to offer. And as a result, many tattoo to offer. And as a result, many tattoo to offer. And as a result, many tattoo seekers end up wanting to work with a seekers end up wanting to work with a seekers end up wanting to work with a tattoo artist that is out of reach. tattoo artist that is out of reach. tattoo artist that is out of reach. Black Dot has solved all of these issues Black Dot has solved all of these issues Black Dot has solved all of these issues and more. We've recently introduced the and more. We've recently introduced the and more. We've recently introduced the world's first automatic tattooing device world's first automatic tattooing device world's first automatic tattooing device paired with an online marketplace for paired with an online marketplace for paired with an online marketplace for high-end tattoo high-end tattoo high-end tattoo art. Licensed designs are uploaded into art. Licensed designs are uploaded into art. Licensed designs are uploaded into our platform and the Black Dot device our platform and the Black Dot device our platform and the Black Dot device tattoos at a level of precision that tattoos at a level of precision that tattoos at a level of precision that hasn't existed until now. We use hasn't existed until now. We use hasn't existed until now. We use fantastically small black dots, roughly fantastically small black dots, roughly fantastically small black dots, roughly the size of a human hair, as the pixel the size of a human hair, as the pixel the size of a human hair, as the pixel to create our tattoos. With Black Dot, to create our tattoos. With Black Dot, to create our tattoos. With Black Dot, we've created something that's scalable. we've created something that's scalable. we've created something that's scalable. So Sharks, it's time to roll up your So Sharks, it's time to roll up your So Sharks, it's time to roll up your sleeves and for $1.5 million for 5% sleeves and for $1.5 million for 5% sleeves and for $1.5 million for 5% equity. How is that all? You can join equity. How is that all? You can join equity. How is that all? You can join Black Dot and be a part of the tattoo Black Dot and be a part of the tattoo Black Dot and be a part of the tattoo revolution. So Joel, do you have a revolution. So Joel, do you have a revolution. So Joel, do you have a business behind this? We do. So what business behind this? We do. So what business behind this? We do. So what we've done here is I This is fake skin, we've done here is I This is fake skin, we've done here is I This is fake skin, synthetic skin, and these are tattoos by synthetic skin, and these are tattoos by synthetic skin, and these are tattoos by the black dot device. Okay. I just the black dot device. Okay. I just the black dot device. Okay. I just figured this was So it's down to a very figured this was So it's down to a very figured this was So it's down to a very fine level. Like when you look at this fine level. Like when you look at this fine level. Like when you look at this here, it's extremely fine. Do tattoo here, it's extremely fine. Do tattoo here, it's extremely fine. Do tattoo artists hate you. Some do. Well, yeah, artists hate you. Some do. Well, yeah, artists hate you. Some do. Well, yeah, because you take their jobs. Well, because you take their jobs. Well, because you take their jobs. Well, that's not necessarily the case. Here's that's not necessarily the case. Here's that's not necessarily the case. Here's how it works. First of all, when we how it works. First of all, when we how it works. First of all, when we license designs, we license them from license designs, we license them from license designs, we license them from tattoo artists as well as visual tattoo artists as well as visual tattoo artists as well as visual artists. And every time every tattoo artists. And every time every tattoo artists. And every time every tattoo artist, every time a t a licensed tattoo artist, every time a t a licensed tattoo artist, every time a t a licensed tattoo is executed, that artist gets paid. So, is executed, that artist gets paid. So, is executed, that artist gets paid. So, actually for tattoo artists, for the actually for tattoo artists, for the actually for tattoo artists, for the first time ever, we're enabling them to first time ever, we're enabling them to first time ever, we're enabling them to scale in an industry with a low ceiling. scale in an industry with a low ceiling. scale in an industry with a low ceiling. Right now, they just trade time for Right now, they just trade time for Right now, they just trade time for money. Yeah. I'm into the tattoos. I got money. Yeah. I'm into the tattoos. I got money. Yeah. I'm into the tattoos. I got over $300,000 worth of ink on my body. over $300,000 worth of ink on my body. over $300,000 worth of ink on my body. Do you really? Do you really? I do. I Do you really? Do you really? I do. I Do you really? Do you really? I do. I do. Because my tattoo artist is one of do. Because my tattoo artist is one of do. Because my tattoo artist is one of the top in the world, Arlo. And he's the top in the world, Arlo. And he's the top in the world, Arlo. And he's really expensive. Wow. What is your really expensive. Wow. What is your really expensive. Wow. What is your business model? Just give me the business model? Just give me the business model? Just give me the breakdown. First of all, this company breakdown. First of all, this company breakdown. First of all, this company was founded in 2019. We're was founded in 2019. We're was founded in 2019. We're venture-backed.

Oh, we launched the company um formerly in October of last year. And so formerly in October of last year. And so formerly in October of last year. And so what we've done is we had three very what we've done is we had three very what we've done is we had three very different artists um just to kind of different artists um just to kind of different artists um just to kind of prove the power of the platform. So the prove the power of the platform. So the prove the power of the platform. So the first artist we worked with Omar Tuna. first artist we worked with Omar Tuna. first artist we worked with Omar Tuna. He's a top artist out of Istanbul. So he He's a top artist out of Istanbul. So he He's a top artist out of Istanbul. So he created a special exclusive collection created a special exclusive collection created a special exclusive collection for Black Dot. And for his tattoos, they for Black Dot. And for his tattoos, they for Black Dot. And for his tattoos, they range in the $2,000 to $3,000 price range in the $2,000 to $3,000 price range in the $2,000 to $3,000 price point. Is that expensive for a tattoo? point. Is that expensive for a tattoo? point. Is that expensive for a tattoo? So Damon, how much would a one of your So Damon, how much would a one of your So Damon, how much would a one of your tattoos have cost? Because he had to do tattoos have cost? Because he had to do tattoos have cost? Because he had to do it by the hour, right? One of my tattoos it by the hour, right? One of my tattoos it by the hour, right? One of my tattoos is 70,000. Okay. So why wouldn't we? is 70,000. Okay. So why wouldn't we? is 70,000. Okay. So why wouldn't we? Yeah. The next artist that we worked Yeah. The next artist that we worked Yeah. The next artist that we worked with was Tyler Hobbs. And Tyler Hobbs is with was Tyler Hobbs. And Tyler Hobbs is with was Tyler Hobbs. And Tyler Hobbs is the number one generative artist in the the number one generative artist in the the number one generative artist in the world. Generative art is using world. Generative art is using world. Generative art is using algorithms and code to create work. His algorithms and code to create work. His algorithms and code to create work. His pieces that are in print, they're all pieces that are in print, they're all pieces that are in print, they're all six figures. They sell at Surbes, six figures. They sell at Surbes, six figures. They sell at Surbes, Christies. I mean, he's tip of the Christies. I mean, he's tip of the Christies. I mean, he's tip of the spear. Okay. And so the price points for spear. Okay. And so the price points for spear. Okay. And so the price points for his tattoos, $9,875 his tattoos, $9,875 his tattoos, $9,875 from your machine, from our device. You from your machine, from our device. You from your machine, from our device. You can make a h 100,000 of those, right? can make a h 100,000 of those, right? can make a h 100,000 of those, right? No, right now we're very supply No, right now we're very supply No, right now we're very supply constrainted. We're based in Austin, constrainted. We're based in Austin, constrainted. We're based in Austin, Texas. I have one black dot device, Texas. I have one black dot device, Texas. I have one black dot device, right? So I don't have a fleet. Is there right? So I don't have a fleet. Is there right? So I don't have a fleet. Is there more pain or less pain? People rate it more pain or less pain? People rate it more pain or less pain? People rate it as two out of 10 on a pain scale. The as two out of 10 on a pain scale. The as two out of 10 on a pain scale. The average whereas a traditional tattoo is average whereas a traditional tattoo is average whereas a traditional tattoo is 5 to eight. So what are you selling us 5 to eight. So what are you selling us 5 to eight. So what are you selling us here today? So, originally, uh, the here today? So, originally, uh, the here today? So, originally, uh, the business plan was to be able to create business plan was to be able to create business plan was to be able to create our own studios, Black Dot Studios, our own studios, Black Dot Studios, our own studios, Black Dot Studios, owned and operated. But now, now that owned and operated. But now, now that owned and operated. But now, now that I've been out talking to the investors, I've been out talking to the investors, I've been out talking to the investors, we've only pivoted the business recently we've only pivoted the business recently we've only pivoted the business recently to make the Black Dot device available to make the Black Dot device available to make the Black Dot device available to tattoo studios. Do you purchase one? to tattoo studios. Do you purchase one? to tattoo studios. Do you purchase one? Do you lease one? So, he only has one. Do you lease one? So, he only has one. Do you lease one? So, he only has one. The plan, the model that probably makes The plan, the model that probably makes The plan, the model that probably makes more sense is to lease it. What does it more sense is to lease it. What does it more sense is to lease it. What does it cost to make a machine? What do you sell cost to make a machine? What do you sell cost to make a machine? What do you sell it for? And please talk about revenue. it for? And please talk about revenue. it for? And please talk about revenue. I'm dying over here. We have to Well, I'm dying over here. We have to Well, I'm dying over here. We have to Well, it's not much, right? But go ahead. it's not much, right? But go ahead. it's not much, right? But go ahead. because you have one machine. So right because you have one machine. So right because you have one machine. So right now our internal cost is about 120,000 now our internal cost is about 120,000 now our internal cost is about 120,000 to be able to build the device. Okay, to be able to build the device. Okay, to be able to build the device. Okay, that's why you want to lease them that's why you want to lease them that's why you want to lease them though, right? Because it's so expensive though, right? Because it's so expensive though, right? Because it's so expensive to get any type of markup. It's going to to get any type of markup. It's going to to get any type of markup. It's going to be really difficult for third parties to be really difficult for third parties to be really difficult for third parties to just come in. 130,000 is what I'm doing just come in. 130,000 is what I'm doing just come in. 130,000 is what I'm doing with my engineering team now. As soon as with my engineering team now. As soon as with my engineering team now. As soon as you have a contract manufacturer, we you have a contract manufacturer, we you have a contract manufacturer, we have line of sight to be able to Sorry. have line of sight to be able to Sorry. have line of sight to be able to Sorry. We have line of sight to be able to get We have line of sight to be able to get We have line of sight to be able to get this down to about $50,000 per unit. One this down to about $50,000 per unit. One this down to about $50,000 per unit. One machine. How many tattoos have you made machine. How many tattoos have you made machine. How many tattoos have you made with it? Um, we've made over a hundred. with it? Um, we've made over a hundred. with it? Um, we've made over a hundred. How many paying clients? Most of them How many paying clients? Most of them How many paying clients? Most of them are test people as we've been testing are test people as we've been testing are test people as we've been testing the product. Okay. So, we know 120 to the product. Okay. So, we know 120 to the product. Okay. So, we know 120 to 30,000 to make it to make the device. If 30,000 to make it to make the device. If 30,000 to make it to make the device. If I wanted to buy it, I have my own tattoo I wanted to buy it, I have my own tattoo I wanted to buy it, I have my own tattoo shop and I want to buy it. I don't have shop and I want to buy it. I don't have shop and I want to buy it. I don't have a price for you right now. We've only a price for you right now. We've only a price for you right now. We've only recently been able to make this recently been able to make this recently been able to make this transition to be able to lease it. So, transition to be able to lease it. So, transition to be able to lease it. So, so what have you spent the four million so what have you spent the four million so what have you spent the four million on? If you don't have a business plan on? If you don't have a business plan on? If you don't have a business plan and exceptionally hard to be able to do and exceptionally hard to be able to do and exceptionally hard to be able to do all my team on the engineering side are all my team on the engineering side are all my team on the engineering side are all Johns Hopkins PhD. Yeah. Look, it is all Johns Hopkins PhD. Yeah. Look, it is all Johns Hopkins PhD. Yeah. Look, it is hard. hard. hard. machine essentially. It took that long. machine essentially. It took that long. machine essentially. It took that long. Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There is no business plan. You want me to give is no business plan. You want me to give is no business plan. You want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a journey of chaos with you? All sharks are still in, but they are All sharks are still in, but they are All sharks are still in, but they are struggling to understand Joel's business struggling to understand Joel's business struggling to understand Joel's business plan for his robotic tattoo company, plan for his robotic tattoo company, plan for his robotic tattoo company, Black Dot. Joel, am I wrong in saying Black Dot. Joel, am I wrong in saying Black Dot. Joel, am I wrong in saying this? There is no business plan. You this? There is no business plan. You this? There is no business plan. You want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% want me to give you 1.5 million for 5% to go into a journey of chaos with you? to go into a journey of chaos with you? to go into a journey of chaos with you? That's not fair at all. In fact, all That's not fair at all. In fact, all That's not fair at all. In fact, all right, before we go off on a tangent right, before we go off on a tangent right, before we go off on a tangent before, okay, let the hard part and by before, okay, let the hard part and by before, okay, let the hard part and by the way, there's patents. We have four the way, there's patents. We have four the way, there's patents. We have four issued patents. So, what we're trying to issued patents. So, what we're trying to issued patents. So, what we're trying to do is get a real feel for how you would do is get a real feel for how you would do is get a real feel for how you would grow the business. So, what you're grow the business. So, what you're grow the business. So, what you're telling me is we'll give you the benefit telling me is we'll give you the benefit telling me is we'll give you the benefit of the doubt. $50,000 to make a machine. of the doubt. $50,000 to make a machine. of the doubt. $50,000 to make a machine. You're going to then lease it to others. You're going to then lease it to others. You're going to then lease it to others. You're going to charge how much? Because You're going to charge how much? Because You're going to charge how much? Because you had to have done this math, right, you had to have done this math, right, you had to have done this math, right, to figure out if the internal math that to figure out if the internal math that to figure out if the internal math that I have. Yep. What is the revenue per I have. Yep. What is the revenue per I have. Yep. What is the revenue per machine per month? On an annual basis, machine per month? On an annual basis, machine per month? On an annual basis, it's roughly a million dollars and it's roughly a million dollars and it's roughly a million dollars and margins on that were like 79%. But you margins on that were like 79%. But you margins on that were like 79%. But you don't really know because you simp. don't really know because you simp. don't really know because you simp. Let's oversimplify it. I get a machine. Let's oversimplify it. I get a machine. Let's oversimplify it. I get a machine. I'm a tattoo shop. I run $2,000 a day on I'm a tattoo shop. I run $2,000 a day on I'm a tattoo shop. I run $2,000 a day on tattoos. tattoos. tattoos. $10,000 a week, $40,000 a month tattoo. $10,000 a week, $40,000 a month tattoo. $10,000 a week, $40,000 a month tattoo. So, okay. So, let's say you know that So, okay. So, let's say you know that So, okay. So, let's say you know that thing is running about an hour, right? thing is running about an hour, right? thing is running about an hour, right? And you're you're open 8 hours. So, And you're you're open 8 hours. So, And you're you're open 8 hours. So, that's the model on probably how much a that's the model on probably how much a that's the model on probably how much a shop can do with the machine. How do you shop can do with the machine. How do you shop can do with the machine. How do you get paid? So, what we would do is I get paid? So, what we would do is I get paid? So, what we would do is I mean, you'd have a a flat rate mean, you'd have a a flat rate mean, you'd have a a flat rate presumably for a leasing piece. Um, they presumably for a leasing piece. Um, they presumably for a leasing piece. Um, they would be able to go ahead and put their would be able to go ahead and put their would be able to go ahead and put their own artwork in it to be able to use it. own artwork in it to be able to use it. own artwork in it to be able to use it. There's probably a subscription service There's probably a subscription service There's probably a subscription service for being able to go ahead and leverage for being able to go ahead and leverage for being able to go ahead and leverage that. And then there's in all likelihood that. And then there's in all likelihood that. And then there's in all likelihood a marketplace. the marketplace that a marketplace. the marketplace that a marketplace. the marketplace that we've designed which they would have we've designed which they would have we've designed which they would have access to as well. We get a piece of access to as well. We get a piece of access to as well. We get a piece of that as well as the contributing artist. that as well as the contributing artist. that as well as the contributing artist. Joel, Joel, Joel, can can I jump in for Joel, Joel, Joel, can can I jump in for Joel, Joel, Joel, can can I jump in for a second? Let me just say something a second? Let me just say something a second? Let me just say something about this that is kind of rubbing me about this that is kind of rubbing me about this that is kind of rubbing me the wrong way. There are three levels. the wrong way. There are three levels. the wrong way. There are three levels. It's go to product phase and then it's It's go to product phase and then it's It's go to product phase and then it's go to market phase and then it's go to go to market phase and then it's go to go to market phase and then it's go to scale phase. I love the go to scale scale phase. I love the go to scale scale phase. I love the go to scale phase because now you have a product, phase because now you have a product, phase because now you have a product, you know what your market is and you you know what your market is and you you know what your market is and you just kind of ramp up. you're still in just kind of ramp up. you're still in just kind of ramp up. you're still in product phase and this costs a lot of product phase and this costs a lot of product phase and this costs a lot of money to build a two-sided market while money to build a two-sided market while money to build a two-sided market while simultaneously building these machines simultaneously building these machines simultaneously building these machines and raising all of this capital. But and raising all of this capital. But and raising all of this capital. But because of the complexity here and the because of the complexity here and the because of the complexity here and the stage that you're at, unfortunately, I'm stage that you're at, unfortunately, I'm stage that you're at, unfortunately, I'm out. out. out.

In terms of presenting a market that In terms of presenting a market that In terms of presenting a market that we've never looked at this way on Shark we've never looked at this way on Shark we've never looked at this way on Shark Tank in 16 years that's very large, I'm Tank in 16 years that's very large, I'm Tank in 16 years that's very large, I'm going to give you a 10. I'm going to going to give you a 10. I'm going to going to give you a 10. I'm going to give you a negative six on presentation give you a negative six on presentation give you a negative six on presentation skills because you're all over the map. skills because you're all over the map. skills because you're all over the map. I'm just being honest with you. You've I'm just being honest with you. You've I'm just being honest with you. You've got to deliver some essence of a pathway got to deliver some essence of a pathway got to deliver some essence of a pathway to where I give you a million5 and to where I give you a million5 and to where I give you a million5 and somehow I get it back times X maybe 10, somehow I get it back times X maybe 10, somehow I get it back times X maybe 10, 20, 30 times. That's why I'm an 20, 30 times. That's why I'm an 20, 30 times. That's why I'm an investor. But because you chose such a investor. But because you chose such a investor. But because you chose such a large number, a million five, I got to large number, a million five, I got to large number, a million five, I got to have some essence of a plan. Has to be have some essence of a plan. Has to be have some essence of a plan. Has to be buttoned up. And and you didn't deliver buttoned up. And and you didn't deliver buttoned up. And and you didn't deliver on that. Very nice guy. Very interesting on that. Very nice guy. Very interesting on that. Very nice guy. Very interesting idea. And if I was going to get a idea. And if I was going to get a idea. And if I was going to get a tattoo, I'd want this machine cuz I I tattoo, I'd want this machine cuz I I tattoo, I'd want this machine cuz I I like level two pain, not 10. I get that. like level two pain, not 10. I get that. like level two pain, not 10. I get that. But but you just sucked in terms of But but you just sucked in terms of But but you just sucked in terms of presentation. I'm out. Yeah, Joe, I presentation. I'm out. Yeah, Joe, I presentation. I'm out. Yeah, Joe, I don't think you were that bad. But don't think you were that bad. But don't think you were that bad. But here's what I think you did leave out. here's what I think you did leave out. here's what I think you did leave out. Once you pivoted to having a machine, Once you pivoted to having a machine, Once you pivoted to having a machine, you talked about the end user as opposed you talked about the end user as opposed you talked about the end user as opposed to the customer who is a tattoo shop or to the customer who is a tattoo shop or to the customer who is a tattoo shop or somebody who wants to open up one, somebody who wants to open up one, somebody who wants to open up one, right? and identifying the value to them right? and identifying the value to them right? and identifying the value to them because they're the ones that have to because they're the ones that have to because they're the ones that have to make the hardest decisions. And so you make the hardest decisions. And so you make the hardest decisions. And so you have to be able to model all that out to have to be able to model all that out to have to be able to model all that out to sell them and you didn't get into any of sell them and you didn't get into any of sell them and you didn't get into any of that in terms of the economic benefit to that in terms of the economic benefit to that in terms of the economic benefit to them so we can understand the economic them so we can understand the economic them so we can understand the economic benefit to us and that's what was benefit to us and that's what was benefit to us and that's what was missing because that's still confusing missing because that's still confusing missing because that's still confusing and uncertain.
