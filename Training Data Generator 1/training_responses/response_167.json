  "executiveSummary": "Abby Jordan and Becky App pitched eCreamery Ice Cream, requesting $250,000 for 33% equity in their personalized ice cream gift business. Despite having $2 million in total sales since 2007 and being on track for $750,000 this year, all Sharks declined to invest. Kevin O'Leary offered $125,000 for 25% but withdrew when no other Shark partnered with him. Main concerns were the existing investor owning 70%, high customer acquisition costs, dual retail/online operations, and competition risks.",
  "keyDecisions": "All five Sharks decided not to invest in eCreamery. Kevin O'Leary initially offered $125,000 for 25% equity (half the requested amount) but withdrew the offer when no other Shark joined as a partner. The entrepreneurs were advised to consider shutting down their retail store and focusing solely on online operations.",
